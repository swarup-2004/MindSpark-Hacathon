""The rooftops of the world are caving in,"" Guterres said on a visit to the Everest region in mountainous Nepal, adding that the country had lost nearly a third of its ice in just over three decades. ""Glaciers are icy reservoirs -- the ones here in the Himalayas supply fresh water to well over a billion people,"" he said. ""When they shrink, so do river flows."" Nepal's glaciers melted 65 percent faster in the last decade than in the previous one, said Guterres, who is on a four-day visit to Nepal. Glaciers in the wider Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges are a crucial water source for around 240 million people in the mountainous regions, as well as for another 1.65 billion people in the South Asian and Southeast Asian river valleys below. The glaciers feed 10 of the world's most important river systems, including the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, Mekong and Irrawaddy, and directly or indirectly supply billions of people with food, energy, clean air and income. Scientists say they are melting faster than ever before due to climate change, exposing communities to unpredictable and costly disasters. ""I am here today to cry out from the rooftop of the world: stop the madness"", Guterres said, speaking from Syangboche village, with the icy peak of the world's highest mountain Everest towering behind him. ""The glaciers are retreating, but we cannot. We must end the fossil fuel age,"" he said. The world has warmed an average of nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius since the mid-1800s, unleashing a cascade of extreme weather, including more intense heatwaves, more severe droughts and storms made more ferocious by rising seas. Hardest hit are the most vulnerable people and the world's poorest countries, which have done little to contribute to the fossil fuel emissions that drive up temperatures. ""We must act now to protect people on the frontline, and to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, to avert the worst of climate chaos,"" Guterres said. ""The world can't wait."" In the first phase of climate change's effects, melting glaciers can trigger destructive floods. ""Melting glaciers mean swollen lakes and rivers flooding, sweeping away entire communities"", he added. But all too soon, glaciers will dry up if change is not made, he warned. ""In the future, major Himalayan rivers like the Indus, the Ganges and Brahmaputra could have massively reduced flows, he said. ""That spells catastrophe""."

The flash floods seem to have been triggered by a combination of factors. A cloud burst ripped apart the South Shonak Lake — a glacial body in the state’s northwest. According to Sikkim’s Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), the Teesta has inundated at least four districts in the state. The calamity was aggravated by the release of water from the Chungthang dam — initial reports suggest that the breach was caused by water rushing from the mountains. Disaster management authorities are also investigating the possibility of the event being triggered by an earthquake in Nepal on Tuesday. The probe is likely to throw more light on the immediate causes of the flash flood but one thing has long been clear — states in the Himalayan region must respect the fragile ecology of the mountains and put in adequate safeguards to mitigate the damage caused by increasingly frequent extreme rainfall events. For years, studies have red-flagged the South Shonak Lake’s expansion due to glacial melting and warned that the water body is susceptible to breaches. In 2021, for instance, a study by scientists from IIT Roorkee, Indian Institute of ScienceBangalore, University of Dayton, USA, University of Graz, Austria, and the Universities of Zurich and Geneva in Switzerland recommended regular monitoring of the lake’s growth and continuous assessment of the region’s slope stability. The National Disaster Management Authority guidelines also say that risk reduction has to begin with mapping such water bodies, taking structural measures to prevent their breach and establishing mechanisms that can alert people about glacial lake outbursts. The IMD has collaborated with the US National Weather Service to warn people about six to 24 hours before a flash flood. But the system doesn’t seem to have come to terms with the Himalayan region’s idiosyncrasies. The Northeast has a key place in the hydel power push of successive governments at the Centre. The Chungthang Dam is a part of the 1,200 MW Teesta Stage 3 Hydroelectric Project. The government claims that such projects are climate-friendly because of their low emissions intensity. Hydroelectric power is also a major source of revenue for Sikkim. Ecologists, however, caution against the adverse effects of dam construction — it increases the volatility of rocks in the Himalayan region. Wednesday’s disaster is a warning to take such caveats seriously and install robust safety mechanisms."

New Delhi, India– Israel’srelentless bombingof the besieged Gaza Strip and killing of nearly 6,000 people – a third of them children – in two weeks has outraged people across the world, triggering mass protests and a call for an immediate ceasefire. However, in India – the first non-Arab country to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), but now seen closer to Israel and its biggest benefactor, the United States – some pro-Palestine protesters reported being targeted by the government. Less than a week after the Gaza assault began, police in Hamirpur district of India’s most populous Uttar Pradesh state were looking for Muslim scholars Atif Chaudhary and Suhail Ansari. Their alleged crime: putting a WhatsApp display photo that said: “I stand with Palestine.” The two men were charged with promoting enmity between social groups. Ansari is under arrest, while Chaudhary is on the run, according to the police. In the same state, governed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), four students of the Aligarh Muslim University were booked by the police after they took out a pro-Palestine march on the campus a day after the Gaza assault began on October 7. However, when the Hindu far-right group Bajrang Dal took out a pro-Israel march in the same Aligarh city, raising slogans such as “Down with Palestine, Down with Hamas”, no action was taken against them by the authorities. In the national capital, New Delhi, there have been several examples of people being detained during rallies organised by student groups, activists and citizens for solidarity with the Palestinians since October 7.      In the western state of Maharashtra, also governed by the BJP in alliance with a regional party, two protesters, Ruchir Lad and Supreeth Ravish, were arrested on October 13 for holding a march against the war on Gaza and charged with unlawful assembly. Pooja Chinchole, member of the Revolutionary Workers Party of India and one of the organisers of the protest held in state capital Mumbai, told Al Jazeera the police “created many hurdles before us when they got to know that we are organising a pro-Palestine protest”. “They detained one of the organisers a day before the protest and three organisers on the morning of the protest. When we still gathered to protest, they snatched our microphone, placards, and after a while, started using force on some of us,” she said. The crackdown, however, was not limited to the BJP-ruled states only. In the southern Karnataka state, governed by the main opposition Congress party, police charged 10 activists with creating a public nuisance after they organised a silent march in support of the Palestinians on October 16 in Bengaluru, the capital of the state. The Karnataka police also arrested a 58-year-old Muslim man for allegedly posting a video in support of Hamas on WhatsApp. Police also briefly detained Alam Nawaz, a Muslim government employee, for updating his WhatsApp status with a Palestinian flag and “Long Live Palestine” message. “People started seeing me with suspicion as if I have committed some crime by expressing my solidarity with Palestinian people,” Nawaz, 20, told Al Jazeera. All this despite the Congress expressing its support for the “rights of the Palestinian people to land, self-government and to live with dignity” as the party called for an immediate ceasefire in a resolution passed by its working committee on October 9. Meanwhile, pro-Israel rallies, organised mainly byHindu right-wing groups, were seen across India, while many on social media offered their services to the Israeli forces. On Saturday, dozens of supporters of a retired Indian army soldier travelled 182km (113 miles) to reach the Israeli embassy in New Delhi where they offered to go to Israel to fight against the Palestinians in Gaza. Last week, one of India’s most influential Hindu nationalists, Yati Narsinghanand, released a video in which he said Hindus and Jews “have the same enemy: Muhammad and his satanic book” as he urged the Israeli government to allow 1,000 Hindus to settle in Israel in order to “take on those Muslims”.      Israel’s ambassador to India, Naor Gilon, on October 8 said he had received several requests from Indians wanting to voluntarily fight for Israel. Apoorvanand, professor of Hindi language at Delhi University, told Al Jazeera he was not surprised that the Hindu far right, which openly admires Adolf Hitler for his action against the Jews, is now supporting the Zionists in Israel. “Hindu far-right organisations in India have always supported those who dominate by violence. Hitler did once, so they supported him. Now Israel is doing this, so they are supporting it,” he said. Apoorvanand said the Hindu right in India thinks there are ideological linkages between them and the Zionists in Israel. “It looks like Israel is fighting a proxy war on behalf of the Hindu far right. They think Israel is fighting and decimating Muslims on their behalf. The way they want to establish Akhand Bharat [Unified India] by joining Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal together with India, they think Israel is following the same expansionist ideology,” he said. This was not always the case. India’s foreign policy has historically supported the Palestinian cause, which began with India voting against the United Nations resolution to create the state of Israel in 1947 and then recognising the PLO as a representative of the Palestinian people in 1974. India’s pro-Palestine stand was guided by the shared history of colonisation by the British, Zikrur Rahman, former Indian ambassador to Palestine, told Al Jazeera. “In the postcolonial era, we identified that this is a colonial attempt to divide the country and to create another country. We were not in favour of the creation of a country on the basis of religion,” he said.      Rahman, however, added that while India’s position on Palestine has not changed, it is not as strong as it used to be. India recognised the creation of Israel in 1950, but did not establish diplomatic relations until 1992, when the details of the firstOslo Accordwere being finalised. Since then, India has tried to strike a balance between its strategic relations with Israel and sympathising with the Palestinian struggle. Today, India is the largest buyer of Israeli-made weapons, while strategic and security cooperation between them has grown manifold. Comparisons have also been made between Israel demolishing homes of Palestinians in the occupied territories and a similar policy adopted by some BJP state governmentsmainly against Muslimsas forms of “collective punishment” of the community. Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, he has made public statements, calling his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu a “good friend” on several occasions. Modi was one of the first global leaders to post his solidarity with Israel after Hamas’s unprecedented incursion on October 7. “Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel,” said his post on X, which came four hours before US President Joe Biden reacted to the event. Modi also condemned the Israeli attack onal-Ahli Arab Hospitalin Gaza on October 18, in which nearly 500 Palestinians were killed, though his message on X appeared nearly eight hours after Biden’s post. Meanwhile, India’s Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement on October 12, reiterating New Delhi’s position of establishing a “sovereign, independent, and viable state of Palestine, living within secure and recognised borders, side by side at peace with Israel”. Last week, Modi posted on X about his phone call with the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, in which he repeated India’s “longstanding principled position on the Israel-Palestine issue”. He said his government is sending humanitarian assistance for the besieged residents of Gaza. Journalist Anand K Sahay, however, thinks India’s response to the unfolding humanitarian disaster in Gaza has not been adequate. “What India didn’t say is important. India didn’t demand a ceasefire. Historically, India has always demanded a ceasefire in case of a [foreign] war. In this case also we should have strongly said: stop the war,” he told Al Jazeera. Sahay said Modi’s flaunting of closeness with Israel is also aimed at appeasing his core vote bank: the Hindus. “Suppose there was another religion in majority in Palestine. Then our stand may have been different. During the Russia-Ukraine war, we said ‘this is not an age of war’. Why couldn’t we say this in case of Israel-Palestine war?” asked Sahay. “By not asking for a ceasefire, India was also indirectly signalling the US that the Indian position was very close to the US line.”               Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Its largest airlines have ordered nearly 1,000 jets this year, committing tens of billions of dollars to a spending spree that is unparalleled in aviation. In NewDelhi, Indira Gandhi International Airport will be ready for 109 million passengers next year, as it prepares to become the world’s second busiest, behind Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the United States. And this is happening in a vast country still heavily reliant on trains — with 20 journeys by rail for every one by air. The enormous aviation build-out, with a surge of investment behind it, has pride of place in India’s case for a greater standing on the world stage. As it moves up the ranks of the world’s biggest economies, India is scrambling to meet the expanding ambitions of its ascendant middle class. Its airports present highly visible achievements. Air travel remains out of the financial reach of most Indians. An estimated 3% of the country’s population flies on a regular basis. But in a nation of 1.4 billion people, that percentage represents 42 million — executives, students and engineers who yearn to get quickly from here to there inside India’s borders, and to gain easier access to destinations beyond, for both business and vacation. Kapil Kaul, CEO of CAPA India, an advisory firm focused on aviation, calls “the next two to three years critical for achieving the quality of growth that India desires and deserves.” Growth has so far been profitless. Now Indian aviation must prove it can make money. The effects of the spending spree should redound across India’s economy. Cargo comes with passenger traffic, and foreign investment tends to follow closely behind, Kaul said. Arrivals to the international terminal at Indira Gandhi Airport are greeted by a wall of giant sculptural hands, their fingers and palms folded into the signifying shapes of the Buddha’s gestures, looking both ancient and futuristic. In 2012, when they were installed, 30 million passengers passed through the airport. By the time the airport has expanded to its new capacity, another one will have been built from scratch on the other side of the city. Indira Gandhi Airport is racing to get bigger. In July it added a fourth runway and opened an elevated taxiway. The company that operates it, GMR Airports, took over in 2006, a time when all arrivals walked past cows lazing in the dust to reach a taxi stand. By 2018 the facility was rated as India’s most valuable infrastructural asset. To spare the use of jet fuel, a battery-powered TaxiBot lugs idling planes around the tarmac. An automated luggage-handling system can sort 6,000 bags an hour. Two beneficiaries of India’s expanding aviation market are the world’s largest airplane makers: Boeing in America and Airbus in Europe. In February, Air India, which Tata Group took private last year, agreed to buy 250 planes from Airbus and 220 from Boeing, worth a combined $70 billion. In June, IndiGo, the country’s biggest carrier by passengers and flights, ordered 500 new Airbus A230s. The bulk of the growth of Indian aviation has been among homegrown airlines, which have clocked a 36% increase in passengers since 2022. Foreign tourist arrivals are rebounding since the pandemic, but are still relatively scarce, barely topping 10 million in a good year (about the same as Romania). So low-cost carriers are adding new countries to their destinations in order to accommodate India’s demand for foreign tourism. Azerbaijan, Kenya and Vietnam are all a direct flight from Delhi orMumbai, India’s financial capital, for less than 21,000 rupees ($250) one way. The air corridor between Delhi and Mumbai was already one of the world’s 10 busiest. Like Delhi, Mumbai has new airport terminals that would be the envy of any city in America, not to mention the glorious new all-bamboo Terminal 2 at Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru, a city in southern India. But the expansion in infrastructure is not limited to the country’s premier metropolitan areas. Prime MinisterNarendra Modi’s government likes to point out that the number of airports has doubled in the nine years since he took office, to 148 from 74. Jyotiraditya Scindia, Modi’s aviation minister, said there would be at least 230 by 2030. The government has invested more than $11 billion in airports over the past decade, and Scindia has promised another $15 billion. That means that sleepy towns such asDarbhanga, a former principality in the impoverished state of Bihar in eastern India, now have nonstop access to Delhi, Bengaluru and beyond. For many of the 900 travelers a day who fill its flights, including plenty from nearby Nepal, the new airport has transformed the journey. Prasanna Kumar Jha, 52, was born in Darbhanga but works in Delhi as a tax consultant. “Who ever expected that Darbhanga would be on the air map?” he asked. Flying to his hometown on short notice to see his ailing mother cost him 10,500 rupees ($126), which pinched. “But if you calculate the alternative — by train from Delhi and then taxi to Darbhanga — it will take at least 30 hours,” he said. “The plane journey is no longer a luxury but a necessity.” Darbhanga’s airport is a far cry from New Delhi’s. There is no parking lot. Passengers walk from the edge of a highway past a checkpoint to wait on benches outside the terminal. Then they wait on another set of outdoor benches after clearing the security check. But it works. Another passenger on the same flight at Darbhanga, Ajay Jha, was cradling his 1-year-old daughter, Saranya, as he stood near the rudimentary baggage claim. His family was on the last leg of a trip that started in Bellevue, Washington, where he works as an engineer for Amazon, to a family reunion in the Bihari countryside. Traveling halfway around the world took less time than Jha used to spend getting home from his school in Bengaluru. Yet a vast majority of Indians cannot afford such conveniences. The annual mean income is still less than a single economy-class fare from the United States, and, in this top-heavy economy, most Indians earn much less than that. Middle class, in Indian parlance, indicates somewhere close to the top of the pyramid. A report by CAPA India counted just 0.13 passenger seats per capita in 2019 for Indians, compared with 0.52 for Chinese and 3.03 for Americans. But aviation companies and India’s elected officials look at the low penetration and see opportunity. A scarcity of competition, in the face of an emerging duopoly between IndiGo and the Tata-led airlines, is one of the new landscape’s most striking features. Smaller competitors keep going bust, most recently Go First, which declared bankruptcy in May. A shortage of pilots, after dozens were poached by bigger companies, forced Akasa Air, a promising upstart, to cancel flights in August. But supply shortages are not the worst kind of problem to have in today’s global economy. With aviation’s growth in the decade before the pandemic steady at about 15% a year, the Indian boom seems all but guaranteed to change the future of aviation worldwide. If the benefits accruing to the winners in India’s economy can be coaxed into trickling outward and downward, the same could go for many other sectors."

Worlds most loved landmarks; Taj Mahal secures 2nd spot,Nepal,"NEW DELHI: India preferred Bangladesh over Nepal for the post of regional director of World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Southeast Asia Region contributing to the comfortable victory of Saima Wazed, daughter of Bangla PM Sheikh Hasina .Although officials were tight-lipped about which way India voted, sources said that it voted for Wazed at the expense of Dr Shambhu Acharya, who could manage one vote, apart from Nepal’s.It could not have been an easy decision as India has been working to improve ties with both neighbours. The decision may have been influenced by Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina’s effort to stop Islamic terrorist groups, many of them backed by Pakistan, from using Bangladesh as a base to launch attacks against India. The personal stake of Sheikh Hasina, who faces an increasingly tough situation on the domestic front ahead of elections next year, in the outcome of a contest featuring her daughter and China’s effort to woo her, also perhaps helped tip scales in Wazed’s favour.Wazed, who is a global autism advocate and has been a member of the WHO’s 25-member expert advisory panel on mental health, would have won in any case as eight of the 10 member nations preferred her over Dr Acharya who is a WHO specialist.WHO said that Wazed’s nomination will be submitted to the WHO executive board during its 154th session, taking place on 22-27 January 2024 in Geneva, Switzerland, and that the newly appointed regional director will take office on 1 February 2024.The Bangladesh High Commission, in its statement announcing the victory, said their ministry of foreign affairs, in coordination with the ministry of health and family welfare, conducted an effective campaign in Wazed’s favour since the very beginning of the election process."

Scientists are increasingly watching how climate change is impacting the environmentally fragile Himalayas, home to the planet's tallest peaks and the source of water for rivers that hundreds of millions of people depend on. Since the end of September, a Chinese team has set up five automatic weather stations on Cho Oyu, at altitudes from 4,950m to its summit at 8,201m, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Friday (Oct 6). Snow and ice samples at the summit had been collected for the first time, Xinhua reported. Initial research showed that the ice layer on Cho Oyu was the thickest among peaks above 8,000m, with a thickness of more than 70m being seen, Xinhua reported. The weather stations on Cho Oyu, which means ""Turquoise Goddess"" in Tibetan, expand a Chinese meteorological network in the Himalayas that includes monitoring of the 8,848m Everest, also on the border with Nepal, and the 8,013m Shishapangma in Tibet. Monitoring the effects of global warming has taken on urgency after one of the warmest summers in the northern hemisphere this year.Mont Blanc, Western Europe's highest peak, has lost more than 2m in height over two yearsbecause of its shrinking snowpack, researchers said on Thursday. Torrential rain in India's northeastern Sikkim state burst the banks of a glacial lake and triggered flash floodsthis week, killing at least 40 people in the latest example of extreme weather events in the mountain range that scientists have blamed on climate change. High-altitude surveillance was imperative to avoid disasters such as floods and ice avalanches as glaciers melt, Xinhua reported, citing Yang Wei, a researcher at the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research of Chinese Academy of Sciences."

Recounting his experience, Mr Board said filming the story was an ""absolute privilege and challenge"". ""Upper Mustang is a naturally breathtaking environment, and while it felt so distant, the local challenges there are so connected to the overall climate change threat that the world is facing,"" he said. ""Reaching the high-altitude glacial lake, featured in the story, was the most physically demanding thing I’ve ever done in my life.

While about 407,000 Indian nationals emigrated in 2021, the country also leads in acquiring citizenship in the OECD area, with the US, followed by Australia and Canada, dominating. According to theresearch, titled“International Migration Outlook: 2023,”released on Monday in France, the US handed out the most passports to Indian immigrants (56,000), followed by Australia (24,000) and Canada (21,000). A total of 133,000 Indians were granted citizenship in an OCED country in 2021. The OECD, which has 38 member countries, was founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. Most of these countries are considered""rich""and""developed""and attract migrant workers and students. Canada, according to the study, recorded the most significant proportional increase in granting citizenship to foreign nationals, with a 174% increase between 2021 and 2022. The North American country, which recently accused New Delhi of conducting a political assassination in a Vancouver suburb, added a record 375,000 new citizens in 2022. The highest number of immigrants issued Canadian passports in 2022 came from India (60,000), followed by the Philippines (42,000), Syria (20,000) and Pakistan (15,000). A shift overseas generally results in higher incomes for Indians. The World Development Report, released in April, showed an estimated 120% gain for Indians who moved abroad for work. According to the report, low-skilled Indians immigrating to the US stand to gain the most, as they would see a jump in income of nearly 500%, followed by immigration to the UAE, at almost 300%. “To step up efforts to actively recruit immigrant workers, several OECD-member countries continue to sign bilateral agreements and advance migration and mobility partnerships with selected origin countries,” the report noted, adding that Portugal, Germany, and Austria have recently concluded agreements on “migration and mobility” with India. Notably, it is the first time that Germany has signed such a bilateral agreement. The report added there was 26% more ‘permanent-type’ immigration to OECD countries in 2022 compared with the previous year, and preliminary figures for 2023 suggest a further increase. With more than 6 million new permanent immigrants, not including Ukrainian refugees, permanent immigration reached a record level in 2022, the report noted. Temporary labor migration, especially of the seasonal variety, also registered a “strong increase.” India has also emerged as the second-largest source of international students in OECD countries; 424,000 Indian students travel abroad for studies in 2021, only surpassed by China, which sent 885,000 students. According to the report, the number of students from India, Vietnam, and Nepal have more than doubled between 2014 and 2021. The report further revealed that Indians account for the largest number of international students in Canada and Latvia."

Violent flooding from glacier lakes dammed by loose rock has become more frequent as global temperatures rise and ice melts, with climate scientists warning it poses an increasing danger across the wider Himalayan mountain range. ""At least 10 people were killed and 102 others reported missing,"" Prabhakar Rai, director of the Sikkim state disaster management authority, told AFP a day after a wall of water rushed down the mountainous valley in northeastern India. Authorities said roads had been ""severely"" damaged and that 14 bridges had been washed away. Rescuers were battling to help those hit by the flood, with communications cut across large areas and roads blocked. ""Floodwaters have caused havoc in four districts of the state, sweeping away people, roads, bridges,"" Himanshu Tiwari, an Indian Army spokesman, told AFP. Twenty-two soldiers are among the missing, the army said. One previously missing soldier was rescued. The army was working to reestablish telephone connections and provide ""medical aid to tourists and locals stranded"", it said in a statement. The water surge came after intense rainfall burst the high-altitude Lhonak Lake, which sits at the base of a glacier in peaks surrounding the world's third-highest mountain, Kangchenjunga. Himalayan glaciers are melting faster than ever due to climate change, exposing communities to unpredictable and costly disasters, according to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) research group. Water powered downstream, adding to a river already swollen by monsoon rains, damaging a dam, sweeping away houses and bridges, and causing ""serious destruction"", the Sikkim state government said. Damage was recorded more than 120 kilometres (75 miles) downstream, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised ""all possible support"" for those affected. Lhonak Lake shrunk by nearly two-thirds in size, an area roughly equivalent to about 150 football pitches (105 hectares), satellite photographs released by the Indian Space Research Organisation showed. ""Intense rain has led to this catastrophic situation in Sikkim where the rain has triggered a glacial lake outburst flood and damaged a dam, and caused loss of life,"" said Miriam Jackson, a scientist specialising in ice who monitors Himalayan regions with the Nepal-based ICIMOD. ""We observe that such extreme events increase in frequency as the climate continues to warm and takes us into unknown territory."" Earth's average surface temperature has risen nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times but high-mountain regions around the world have warmed at twice that pace, climate scientists say. Sikkim is close to India's border with Nepal and China and boasts a sizeable military presence. India has been wary of China's growing military assertiveness and their 3,500-kilometre (2,200-mile) shared frontier has been a perennial source of tension, with parts of Sikkim claimed by Beijing."

In a statement on Thursday, the country’s Ministry of Women and Child Development cited“serious methodological issues,”noting that the Global Hunger Index“continues to be a flawed measure of ‘hunger’ and does not reflect India’s true position.” The Global Hunger Index is released by NGOs Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, from Ireland and Germany, respectively. It is considered a tool for comprehensively measuring and tracking hunger at the global, regional, and national levels. The new edition gave India a score of 28.7, noting that the country has a“serious”level of hunger. According to the report, undernourishment in India stands at 16.6% and the mortality rate for children below the age of five is 3.1%. It also showed that India has the highest child ‘wasting’ (the term describing low weight relative to height) rate in the world, at 18.7%, which reflects acute undernutrition. The index also claims that 58.1% of Indian women aged 15-24 suffer from anemia, a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Notably, India was ranked below neighboring countries Pakistan (102th), Bangladesh (81st), Nepal (69th), and Sri Lanka (60th). In 2022, India ranked 107th out of 121 countries surveyed – again, well below its neighbors. “Three out of the four indicators used for calculation of the index are related to the health of children,”the Health Ministrysaidin a statement, positing that it therefore,“cannot be representative of the entire population.” The government further pointed out that the fourth and“most important indicator,”the ‘proportion of undernourished (PoU) population’, is based on an opinion poll conducted on“a very small sample size of 3,000.”  “The data collected from a miniscule sample for a country of India’s size through FIES has been used to compute PoU value for India which is not only wrong and unethical, it also reeks of obvious bias,”the statement reads. The Health Ministry also claimed that the index didn’t use data collected via the government application called the Poshan Tracker, which was created as part of the drive to address malnutrition. This is despite the fact that key international organizations, including UNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank,“have acknowledged the Poshan Tracker as a game-changer in the area of nutrition,”the statement said. Based on data from the Poshan Tracker, the percentage of child ‘wasting’ in India is consistently below 7.2% month-on-month, which is in stark contrast to the 18.7% value in the Global Hunger Index 2023. The statement also pointed out that“there is hardly any evidence”that child mortality is an outcome of hunger. The Indian government allocated over 112 million metric tonnes of food grains under its food security scheme during the financial years 2020-21 and 2022-23, benefitting nearly 80 million people. It extended the scheme in January 2023, the statement added, calling it the“largest food security program in the world.” "

The area is nearly 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of Kathmandu, and the earthquake was felt in the Nepalese capital. Nepal’s National Earthquake Monitoring and Research Center gave a preliminary magnitude of 6.1. The U.S. Geological Survey provided measurements of a 5.2 magnitude with a depth of 24.7 kilometers (15.4 miles) and an epicenter near Bharatpur. Three tremors of 4.3, 4.1 and 3.8 magnitude also hit the region later Sunday, according to India’s Center for Seismology. The Press Trust of India news agency said the tremors were also felt in Bagmati and Gandaki provinces and caused panic among people. One woman suffered injuries in the Gorkha district, which adjoins Dhading, when she jumped from a two-story building, Parajuli said. Earthquakes are common in mountainous Nepal. A 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2015 killed some 9,000 people and damaged about 1 million structures."

His hotel offers breath-taking mountain views from the town of Lumbini in Nepal - Buddha's birthplace.  But a hoped-for surge in tourist numbers has failed to materialise, blamed in part on tensions between Nepal's giant neighbours India and China. Lumbini saw close to a million visitors in 2022, according to the Lumbini Development Trust - and it was this number the government was betting on when it spent $76m (£61m) to build the Gautam Buddha International Airport, which opened in May last year.  Domestic tourists make up most of the visitors, with just less than a third travelling from neighbouring India.  The terminal, also known as Bhairahawa Airport, lets tourists fly directly to Lumbini instead of travelling 250km (155 miles) by land from the capital, Kathmandu. Yet the anticipated travel boom never materialised, something travel industry experts attribute to a lack of early promotion and incentives to international airlines.  ""The government asked us to expand tourism infrastructure saying more international flights would come. But my hotel is two-thirds empty. I am now struggling to repay my loan,"" Mr Sharma tells the BBC, adding that he is millions of rupees in debt.  Travel industry experts argue tourist arrivals, particularly from overseas, will go up if there are regular scheduled international flights operating out of Bhairahawa airport. But Nepali officials say Delhi has refused to allow big passenger planes to fly west through its airspace - meaning planes cannot fly over India to reach the Gautam Buddha airport.  Access to Indian airspace would mean shorter flights at lower cost. Some in Nepal also believe that Delhi is wary of the fact that the Gautam Buddha airport was constructed by China's Northwest Civil Aviation Airport.  The airport is also located near Nepal's border with India  - west of where the two Asian giants' troops clashed last December in the Arunachal Pradesh region, just seven months after the terminal opened to international traffic. In 2020, a major encounter between India and China killed at least 20 troops. At the centre of their dispute is an ill-defined, poorly-demarcated 3,440km (2,100-mile)-long border- called the Line of Actual Control, or LAC.  The presence of rivers, lakes and snowcaps means the line can shift. The soldiers on either side - representing two of the world's largest armies - come face to face at many points. The situation at the border is mirrored by growing political tension, with strained ties between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Observers say talks are the only way forward because both nuclear-armed countries have much to lose. The two countries have fought only one war, in 1962, when India suffered a humiliating defeat. The Gautum Buddha airport was meant to be the key to Nepal's plan to grow traffic by easing the load of Kathmandu - which has been for years its only international gateway. Kathmandu Airport is heavily congested and was briefly shut down by a powerful earthquake in 2015. A third international airport located in Pokhara - a town with stunning views of the Annapurna mountains and known for adventure sports - is facing a familiar problem to Bhairahawa.  Since it opened last January, the airport - built with a $215m loan from China - has not welcomed any international flights, save for a charter flight from Chengdu that brought in Chinese officials and tourists. Currently, Gautama Buddha and Pokhara have a combined traffic of 80-85 domestic flights per day. But experts say the terminals need substantial international traffic to sustain operations. ""I don't think only domestic flights will make these two airports commercially viable. It may be difficult to repay the loan without regular international flights,"" says Tri Ratna Manandhar, the former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Pokhara International Airport chief Bikram Raj Gautam says Nepal needs ""proactive diplomacy"" to convince countries like India to open their airspace to commercial flights that will land in Nepal. Experts say Nepal can also look at attracting tourists from the east like Thailand, Japan and Cambodia, while Delhi's restrictions choke traffic from the west. Nepal Airlines has just started a weekly flight from Bhairahawa to Kuala Lumpur - something that should send a positive message to other airlines, Dipak Bajracharya, director of the Gautam Buddha International Airport tells the BBC. But Nepal's minister for tourism and civil aviation, Sudan Kiranti, remains optimistic that there will be a resolution with Delhi - and soon.  ""We are in constant touch and dialogue with Indian officials and diplomats,"" he tells the BBC. ""They are very positive."" With additional reporting by Surendra Phuyal in Kathmandu"

Rats have so far dug through the concrete bases of at least two flyovers, gnawed at underground sewerage and cable lines, and taken over the much of the city, from the slums and eateries of south and centralKolkatato the colonial-era buildings of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the Bidhan Sabha at Esplanade. The menace has set off alarm bells in the government, with the Trinamool Congress-run KMC scrambling for solutions — from running awareness campaigns on waste disposal to resorting to quick-fixes and reaching out to its counterparts in other states for ideas to exterminate the rats. Firhad Hakim, Trinamool leader and Kolkata Mayor, admitted toThe Indian Expressthat while they are yet to assess the extent of damage to the wires and cable lines, rats “are a major problem”. “We do not know about the population (of rats), but the effects are visible every day. Our sewerage lines, underground cables and electricity wires are getting damaged,” he told The Indian Express. KMC authorities say central Kolkata, where footpaths are lined with eateries that cater to the office crowd, and the slum areas of south Kolkata’s Dhakuria and Bhabanipore are among the worst affected. It was two years ago that the KMC was alerted to the sinking of the approach road to the Dhakuria Bridge flyover. “We reinforced the road with concrete but the problem persisted. Then we discovered these huge holes underground that rats had burrowed through and realised what was causing the subsidence,” said Mayor Hakim, blaming “illegal squatters” and “roadside eateries that throw waste food on the road” for the problem. KMC sources said rats have also damaged parts of the AJC Bose flyover in south Kolkata, digging through and loosening the soil around the foundation. With no solution in sight and no precedent to fall back on, the corporation has been reinforcing damaged structures and filling up holes on footpaths, roads and walls of bridges with a mix of concrete, sand and glass shards. “We mixed glass shards and sand grains with concrete and used that to fill up holes made by rats on the walls and pillars of flyovers. We hope this mix will restrict their movement, though we have no proof yet if it is working,” said Deputy Mayor Atin Ghosh. Ghosh said the KMC has also been conducting awareness campaigns for roadside eateries and restaurants, asking them not to throw food outside and warning them of legal action. Rat tales:Mumbaito New York From New York to Mumbai, almost every major city has been waging a battle against rat infestation. Aided by uncontrolled urbanisation, rats have outsmarted the best of city administrations, living in the darkest depths of sewerage systems and tunnels and nibbling through anything that comes their way — heaps of overflowing trash, cables, wires, even concrete. Mayor Hakim says that “sometime back”, the KMC approached the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for help. “But they could not help us find a solution,” he said. While BMC authorities did not confirm receiving such a letter from their counterparts in Kolkata, they said their battle against rats is an ongoing one. The BMC’s insecticide department kills lakhs of rats every year as part of its monsoon drive across the city’s 24 wards. The BMC also has ‘rat labourers’, who work in shifts to hunt down rats in the city. As of July this year, 2.81 lakh rats have been killed in Mumbai. But it’s New York’s rat problem that has garnered global attention. From mandating the use of covered trash cans to establishing rat exclusion zones, and appointing a ‘Rat Czar’, Kathleen Corradi, earlier this year to tackle the city’s severe rodent crisis, New York has declared war on the rodents. In an email to The Indian Express, Noah Levine, Chief of Staff of Communications in the office of the Mayor of New York City, said one of the key steps the city took to contain rats was to replace black trash bags with lidded containers to cut down on the food source of the rodents. The rule mandates that all commercial trash — approximately 20 million pounds per day — must be in secure, lidded containers, Levine said, adding that the city’s efforts over the past 20 months have resulted in “rat sightings dropping 25 per cent this summer” compared to last year. From nibbling on toes to exposing footpath plaster Back in Kolkata, rat sightings are easy. On a weekday afternoon, a colony of rats scurry out of the ground near one of the pillars of Dhakuria Bridge, an ageing four-lane flyover in Ballygunge that has a rail line connecting Gariahut to Jadavpur running underneath. Down the flyover and on either side of the railway line are slums, shacks and eateries, with their waste finding space on the tracks and elsewhere. Sitting on the tracks of the Sealdah-Budge Budge railway line, Sonia Mondol, 25, who lives in the slums under the bridge, said, “Rats have been eating this bridge like it’s cake. Every day we see broken parts of the bridge falling off.” Two years ago, Nepal Paul, 40, shifted his tea stall from under the Dhakuria Bridge to a corner of the underpass. “The rats are a huge menace. Look at the holes in the footpath here. They are so big that two people fell down and got injured. I have had to change the plastic containers in my shop to glass,” he said. Around five km away, at the AJC Bose flyover and the nearby Nizam Palace, another of the areas that Hakim identified as rat-infested, Pintu Shaw, 28, a hawker, says, “It’s impossible to do any work here. The rats come and nibble on our toes. The PWD came here and fixed the footpath, but within a month, the holes were back,” said Shaw, pointing to the exposed plaster on the footpath and the flyover. Asim Basu, councillor of ward number 70, said, “Eateries throw leftovers, and the oil and fat from the food stick onto the walls of the underground drains. Rats eat and nibble through the concrete walls of the drain, damaging them.” The KMC headquarters and the Assembly building in the Esplanade area too have had their share of rat tales. A KMC official said, “Rats are everywhere in the KMC, but the worst-hit is the server room. The rats have chewed on the wires and machines there. They have also been damaging the control room’s electric wires regularly.” A senior IT official at the KMC said things have been a little quieter ever since the corporation installed a “RODENT” machine in the server room two months ago. “The machine generates sound waves of a very high frequency which keeps rats away,” the official said. In the Assembly building, Speaker Biman said, “I have seen rats here… with my own eyes. We are very worried. We don’t want to use poison to kill rats because the stench will be unbearable. We have spoken to the Public Works Department about this. Let’s see what can be done.” A senior official said, “Here in the Assembly, I must say rats are the only creatures that are neutral. They trouble both the ruling party as well as the Opposition. Rats have eaten food in Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari’s room and they have damaged papers in the Speaker’s room.” The way out? Experts agree that while rats are everywhere, they are hard to get rid of — and even harder to count. Mukesh Thakur, head of the mammals section at the Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata, said, “It is true that there is almost no data or research on the rat population for the city of Kolkata. If KMC sends us a request, we can possibly look into it.” Shilanjan Bhattacharya, Professor of Zoology at West Bengal State University, said, “The most common rats species in the city are the Rattus norvegicus, the common brown rats with a maximum body length of 6-8 inches, and the Bandicota indica, the Indian bandicoot that can grow up to 1 foot in length and weigh nearly a kg.” “The only way the rat population can be checked is by innovating and allowing natural predators such as owls, monitor lizards and jungle cats to breed and roam in the infested area. If authorities decide that this is an emergency and absolutely necessary, the Forest Department and naturalists can work on how to manage such biological controls. No other mechanical or chemical procedures have ever been successful — especially in humid Indian cities, where garbage is abundant.” Renowned ecologist and academic Professor Madhav Gadgil offers an even more unconventional solution. Talking to The Indian Express, he said, “It may sound unorthodox, but the solution is to catch the rats, remove harmful pathogens if any and turn it into poultry feed. The solution is to bring the rats back into the food chain. In various parts of India, people eat rats, mainly field rats.”"

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to an average of 7.76% in the week ending November 2, down from 7.79% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 6.95%. The news comes a day after the Federal Reserve said in a widely anticipated move that it wouldleave its benchmark lending rate at the highest level in 22 years. “The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage paused its multi-week climb but continues to hover under 8%,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “The Federal Reserve again decided not to raise interest rates but has not ruled out a hike before year-end,” he said. “Coupled with geopolitical uncertainty, this ambiguity around monetary policy will likely have an impact on the overall economic landscape and may continue to stall improvements in the housing market.” Although the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate loan ticked down slightly, it remained elevated in the leadup to the two-day monetary policy meeting, which concluded Wednesday, said Hannah Jones, economic research analyst at Realtor.com. “Though the committee chose to take a pause from further contractionary policy in this week’s meeting, Chair [Jerome] Powell made the point that the committee will remain open to further policy action to bring inflation down to 2% over time, dependent on incoming data,” she said. Realtors found liable for $1.8 billion in damages in conspiracy to keep commissions high Although the Fed does not set the interest rates that borrowers pay on mortgages directly, its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasuries, which move based on a combination of anticipation about the Fed actions, what the Fed actually does and investors’ reactions. When Treasury yields go up, so do mortgage rates; when they go down, mortgage rates tend to follow. On Wednesday the Treasury Department also announced that it will slow the pace of its longer-dated 10-year and 30-year bond issuance. “However, longer-term debt issuance will continue to climb, which keeps upward pressure on mortgage rates,” said Jones. With average rates over 7% since mid-August, applications for mortgages have been trending down. They declined for the third consecutive week as low inventory and high rates continued to stifle borrower demand, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Rates are expected to stay elevated until it becomes clear the Fed is done hiking rates, according to MBA. How the Fed is using its multi-trillion-dollar balance sheet to fight inflation “We were pleased to see that the Fed held short-term rates steady yesterday and continue to believe that it should not hike again and not sell its holdings of mortgage-backed securities until and unless the housing finance market has stabilized,” said Bob Broeksmit, MBA president and CEO. “These actions would help to lower mortgage rates and improve homebuyer affordability heading into 2024.” Mortgage rates should stay stable in the next few months, said Jones, since another two-day monetary policy meeting is not scheduled until December. That should give homebuyers a small bit of comfort, she says. “Today’s buyers face scarce for-sale inventory, still-high listing prices, and multi-decade high mortgage rates, so any potential relief from climbing housing costs is welcomed,” Jones said."

The daughter of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is one of two candidates for the SEARO position. Saima Wazed's nomination has sparked controversy with many health experts calling it ""nepotism,"" and expressing concern over the election process to fill senior roles at the U.N. health body. A candidate for the SEARO post should have a ""strong technical and public health background and extensive experience in global health"", according to the WHO website. The candidate should also have ""competency in organizational management"" and ""proven historical evidence for public health leadership"", the website says. The next SEARO chief will be elected through a secret ballot by the region's 11 member countries, which include Bangladesh, Nepal and India. The vote is scheduled to take place in New Delhi during a WHO regional committee meeting Oct. 30-Nov. 2. Countries in the region nominate candidates to head the WHO regional office. Wazed was nominated by the government of Bangladesh. In addition to Wazed, who is a mental health advocate, only one other candidate has been put forward: Shambhu Acharya, a public health expert and senior WHO official who was nominated by Nepal. Questions have been raised about the disparity between the candidates' qualifications.Wazed has a master's degree in clinical psychology from Barry University, a school in Florida. She has spent nearly a decade serving as an adviser to the director general of the WHO on mental health and autism issues. Acharya has been with the WHO for almost 30 years. He has experience working with the U.N. body in senior positions and holds a Ph.D. in public health, health policy and financing from the University of North Carolina. Sixteen public health experts in Nepal issued a statement saying that Acharya ""is the better fit"" of the two candidates vying for the SEARO director's position. ""[Acharya] possesses a very strong public health background and has extensive leadership experience in tackling global health issues,"" the statement said. ""He knows the public health and medical challenges of our region intimately, having worked for three decades to strengthen responses at local, national, regional and global levels, including in Nepal, Bangladesh and India, apart from his responsibilities at [the] WHO headquarters in Geneva."" So far there have not been any public statements of support for Wazed from public health experts in Bangladesh. Right now a strong anti-Hasina wave is sweeping Bangladesh, ahead of next general election all likely to be held in January. With the US closely monitoring the forthcoming election in Bangladesh many believe the ruling Awami League party will not be able to rig the elections this time and lose power. In such a situation many, long-known as pro-Awami League groups, are not speaking in support of Hasina, her party and family members now. However, AK Abdul Momen, Bangladesh's foreign minister spoke in support of Wazed's candidacy several days ago. In an interview with the Indian newspaper The Hindu, the minister demanded that Nepal withdraw its candidate from the contest for the WHO-SEARO post. ""[Nepal's candidate] had been working in the WHO for the last 30 years and was in a decision-making position. So why have [health indices] not improved in the whole of the South East Asian region, even though he himself is a person of South Asian origin?"" Momen asked while adding that Acharya should ""step down"" from the race for the WHO-SEARO post. Wazed, who has held advisory positions at some Bangladesh government mental health bodies, rebuffed accusations that her nomination was ""fueled by nepotism"" because her mother is the prime minister. She said those critical of her nomination were overlooking her experience and achievements in the field of mental health. ""They ignore that I have been an adviser to WHO's DG on Mental Health & Autism, or that I have been a member of the WHO's Expert Advisory Panel on mental health for almost a decade,"" Wazed wrote in an Inter Press Service opinion piece earlier this month. ""They do not mention that I am [the] chief adviser to Bangladesh's National Mental Health Strategic Plan, or that I was a technical expert for Bangladesh's National Mental Health Act of 2018,"" she wrote. Bangladesh's nomination of Wazed has also come under scrutiny by several activists and public health experts. Bishow Parajuli, former U.N. resident coordinator and U.N. Development Program representative in Myanmar and Zimbabwe, said that Wazed has limited experience and qualifications to assume such a leadership position. ""In a country with so many qualified and competent health professionals, the nomination of Ms. Wazed, and her use of the Prime Ministerial Office to engage with the various world leaders, also shows nepotism and the influence of her mother's office in the process. …The selection must be made 'on the basis of merits,'"" he said in emailed comments. Paris-based Bangladeshi social activist and physician Pinaki Bhattacharya said Wazed has none of the required qualifications for the WHO-SEARO post. ""Hasina and her daughter are not aware that while being a descendant of the powerful can give one political advantage, the position of a professional international health leader requires the necessary education, skills and talent,"" he told VOA. In recent weeks, Wazed accompanied her mother, Sheikh Hasina, on a high-profile diplomatic tour attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York and the summit in New Delhi of the 20 biggest economies, known as the G20. Wazed accompanied Prime Minister Hasina during her meetings with U.S. President Joe Biden, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Wazed said she is used to being held to different professional standards than men, and having her identity reduced to simply being ""her mother's daughter,"" which is blatant sexism, Wazed said. Wazed has not responded to a VOA email requesting direct comment on the nepotism issue. Kent Buse is director of the Global Healthier Societies Program at The George Institute for Global Health at Imperial College London. Buse told VOA that the rules governing the selection of directors across all WHO regions need considerable reform to ensure public confidence in the merit-based nature of the organization. ""This relates to improving transparency and delivering enhanced oversight of the election process. This should include better scrutiny of the candidate's compliance with the existing codes of conduct governing the campaign processes.""  "

He said that 101 people were still missing in the latest of a series of natural disasters caused by extreme weather events in the Himalayas. Fourteen army personnel were among the missing, a defence ministry statement said.

As with many gig economy workers, it was to cover costs while he was between jobs for two months. “I thought it'd be nice to rent a car and drive my mum around. I drove two to four hours a day mainly to pay for the petrol and rental,” he explained. Ironically, just two weeks after he started, job opportunities picked up and he found himself juggling driving with rehearsals, teaching yoga and lecturing classes. The workload became exhausting, so he decided to take a hiatus. Still, Oliver really enjoyed his private hire driving experience – despite the physical toll on his back and bladder – and would return to it should the need arise."

Violent torrents struck Sikkim state on Wednesday after the sudden bursting of a high-altitude glacial lake. Climate scientists warn that similar disasters will become an increasing danger across the Himalayas as global temperatures rise and ice melts. ""So far 26 bodies have been found in Sikkim,"" state relief commissioner Anilraj Rai told AFP by phone. Thirty more bodies had been recovered from the Teesta river basin by search and rescue teams downstream in neighbouring West Bengal state, Jalpaiguri district police superintendent K. Umesh Ganpat told AFP. ""The river stretches up to 86 kilometres,"" he added. ""The search operation is continuing."" Among the dead are seven Indian army soldiers posted in Sikkim, which sits on India's remote frontiers with Nepal and China and boasts a sizeable military presence. Sixteen soldiers are among the more than 100 people still missing. India's defence ministry said in a statement that the floods had washed away ""firearms and explosives"" from military camps. The army has ""established lookout teams all along the river"" to recover loose ordnance, the ministry added. Local media reports on Friday said that two people had been killed and four others injured by a mortar shell that exploded while flowing through the flood waters in West Bengal. Roads, bridges and telephone lines have been destroyed across much of the state, complicating evacuations and efforts to communicate with thousands cut off from the rest of the country. More than 1,200 houses had been damaged by the floods, according to the latest Sikkim government bulletin. More than 2,400 people had been rescued while nearly 7,000 others were taking shelter at makeshift relief camps set up at schools, government offices and guesthouses, the bulletin said. The water surge came after intense rainfall burst the high-altitude Lhonak Lake, which sits at the base of a glacier in peaks surrounding the world's third-highest mountain, Kangchenjunga. Water powered downstream, adding to a river already swollen by monsoon rains, damaging a dam and sweeping away houses. Himalayan glaciers are melting faster than ever due to climate change, exposing communities to unpredictable and costly disasters, according to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) research group. ""The root cause is climate change and this going to increase in the future,"" ICIMOD climate change specialist Arun Bhakta Shrestha told AFP. ""Similar glacial lake outbursts flood events are very likely."" Earth's average surface temperature has risen nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times but high-mountain regions around the world have warmed at twice that pace, climate scientists say."

[+] skin disease which is transmitted by the bite of a certain type of sandfly, in the southern town of Zagora. (Photo by STRINGER / AFP) (Photo by STRINGER/AFP via Getty Images) A disfiguring parasitic infection, common in the tropics, has now found a home in Texas and Oklahoma and is expanding its range in the U.S. The parasite, Leishmania mexicana, is transmitted by tiny sand flies, which are now found in Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and Ohio. Researchers examined 2,100 skin samples. Of these, 1,222 showed the presence of leishmania, and, as expected, almost all the patients had traveled internationally to endemic areas (where the organism commonly occurs), according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, 86 patients had no travel history, meaning they acquired the infection in the U.S. There are different strains of leishmania, and they cause different types of disease. The L mexicana found in Texas and Oklahoma causes the mildest form, cutaneous leishmania, affecting only the skin. It generally requires no treatment, explained Dr. David Freedman, professor emeritus of infectious disease at UAB at Birmingham. L brasiliensis (among other species) causes mucocutaneous leishmania, which I saw while studying in Peru. At that time, it was treated with a nasty antimonial antibiotic called Pentostam, with many side effects. The most severe form of leishmania usually occurs in the Middle East, Asia, and northern Africa, but it can also occur in Latin America or elsewhere in immune compromised people. L donovani species causes this systemic illness called kala-azar. It is visceral—infecting organs throughout the body, including the liver and spleen—and often causes death. All of the U.S. cases are of the milder skin form. The scientists also did special genetic studies of the L mexicana in Texas and found two distinctive genotypes. They called one type “CCC” and found it in 94% of the non-travelers. While the “American strain” was found in samples as long as 18 years ago, Freedman said that Leishmania has probably “been there forever.” He was aware of its presence in Texas in the 1980s. It was “under the CDC’s radar” because the skin lesions usually resolve without any treatment and because it is not a reportable disease. Spread: Leishmania is spread through bites of sand flies. Their normal hosts in the U.S. are wood rats (not common Norway or city rats). Anne Straily (CDC veterinary medical officer) said via email, “There is some debate about whether other wildlife species, like armadillos or opossums, could also serve as reservoir hosts.” In some cases, infected humans can transmit the parasite back to sand flies. For visceral leishmania, the most serious form, dogs are the main reservoir. While dogs are an important reservoir, no transmission of the parasite from dogs to people has been identified. Per Anne Straily, CDC veterinary medical officer, L. infantum (the species that causes the visceral form of disease) “is already present in certain dogs in the U.S., primarily in hunting hounds.” Many dogs are being imported to the U.S. as rescues from Southeast Asia and posing a potential risk here. “No sand flies have been found infected with L. infantum in the U.S., and no human cases of locally acquired visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. infantum have been identified, even among people in contact with infected dogs,” Kamb and Cama said via an email interview. An interdisciplinary working group, including the CDC and public health veterinarians, has developed a new “operational risk assessment tool” to help vets recognize and screen dogs that pose the greatest threat. This tool was presented at the recent American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene meeting and will be published in Emerging Infectious Diseases. Christine Petersen, Director of the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the University of Iowa, explained that most veterinarians are understandably not familiar with this parasite. The risk tool helps them look at where the dog is coming from and what state it is going to. For example, if a dog is going from Italy (or Southeast Asia) to Texas, there is some risk. But “if the dog comes from Sweden and is going to New Hampshire, the risk is very, very low, and we're not worried.” Also of concern is that one-fifth of the 2.7 million soldiers deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan have evidence of asymptomatic visceral leishmania, including parasites in their blood, up to 10 years after returning. They could potentially transmit their infection through insect bites, pregnancy, transfusions or IV drug use. A 27-month-old child from North Dakota, who had never left the state, was found to have a skin infection with L donovani, which causes the visceral form of disease (as does L infantum). It’s unclear exactly how transmission occurred; his mother was from Nepal, but there is no report of having tested her. Prevention: Sand flies are much smaller than mosquitoes, so unless the mesh is sized accordingly, bed nets are less effective in preventing bites. Data on results is mixed, but there is some benefit to insecticide-treated nets. These are usually used in rooms that are also sprayed with insecticides. For personal use, DEET and permethrin are effective preventatives. Challenges: The initial hurdle is getting physicians to diagnose leishmania. Many will not likely have ever seen it nor suspect it. Even on biopsy, it may be missed as the organisms are so tiny, and a special Giemsa stain is required. You won’t know the species from appearance, Freedman explained. Diagnosis is generally done by molecular (PCR) testing at the CDC. Testing is now also available at the University of Washington or at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research for military only. The other major problem is that there are no reporting requirements in states, except in Texas, or to the CDC. Without uniform reporting to the CDC, we have no chance of tracking how frequently and where it occurs. The magnitude of the role of climate change in the spread of leishmania is as yet unknown—this is another reason to have careful tracking. Insecticide resistance is a concern. The Covid-19 pandemic reduced funding for leishmania programs and surveillance and resulted in less spraying. We also need to watch that the visceral type of leishmania does not become endemic in the U.S., becoming established by sand flies feeding on infected dogs. This hasn’t happened yet (that we know of) but requires ongoing monitoring. For many unusual infections, it’s important that physicians take a careful exposure and travel history and have a high index of suspicion. It’s also important that physicians learn to recognize cutaneous leishmaniasis and know that it can occur in people with no history of international travel.

The pledge made Japan the single largest donor - accounting for 20 per cent - of the account that covers the interest payments on loans under the fund's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), Georgieva told reporters at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. Georgieva said a number of new pledges for the subsidy account were received on Wednesday, and further funds were expected when the IMF's steering committee meets on Saturday. The IMF has been urging member countries to fill a $1.2 billion gap in the $3 billion subsidy account endorsed by the membership in 2021. Georgieva said 40 countries had stepped up to contribute, and one-third were emerging market economies. The IMF is expected to release details on the fundraising effort on Saturday. The PRGT is the fund’s main vehicle for providing  low- or zero-interest loans to low-income countries (LICs) that support economic programmes and help leverage additional financing from donors, development institutions, and the private sector. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the IMF said it has supported more than 50 low-income countries with some $29 billion in interest-free loans via the PRGT, reducing instability in a wide range of the world’s poorest nations, from Haiti to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nepal. The IMF projects demand for PRGT lending will reach nearly $40 billion through next year, more than four times the historical average. It says each $1 of subsidy resources allows the PRGT to provide about $5 in zero-interest loans.  "

At the crack of dawn every day, hushed frantic activity begins in villages located along the India-Nepal border here as some residents set out on foot or in small vehicles to smuggle rice into the neighbouring country. Young unemployed men, women and sometimes even the elderly act as carriers for local smugglers and are paid up to Rs 300 for delivering a quintal of rice to warehouses set up across the border by Nepali traders.  Most of them make multiple trips to earn as much money as possible.  Lakshminagar, Thoothibari, Nichlaul, Parsa Malik, Bargadwa, Bhagwanpur, Shyam Kat, Farenia, Hardi Dali and Khanuva are some of the villages from where it is very easy to cross into Nepal and rice is smuggled, police sources said.  Maharajganj shares an 84-km open border with Nawalparasi and Rupandehi districts of Nepal's Lumbini province.  Ram Prasad, a rice carrier, said, ""The Nepali merchants have set up small warehouses along the border where we deliver the smuggled rice. The warehouses are emptied every week and the collected rice is moved to a bigger warehouse.""  The carriers do most of the work at the crack of dawn, travelling up to one kilometre from their homes to deliver the rice. They carry rice bags weighing 10 kg or more.  The second spurt of activity comes post-lunch, when most locals are indoors, enjoying an afternoon siesta. Some of the carriers also move rice bags in the evening, just before nightfall. They rarely move at night as that is when the risk of getting caught is the highest.  According to officials, more than 111.2 tonnes of rice being smuggled into Nepal has been seized by the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and police in the last four months.  Most of the people involved in  rice smuggling  are unemployed. These villagers take rice from the local smugglers and carry it into Nepal. In most cases, young unemployed men and women act as carriers. Sometimes, the elderly can also be involved, the police sources said.  Despite efforts by authorities to check the smuggling of rice, the huge margin of profit continues to drive the illicit activity.  Local rice traders said the price of rice in Nepal has spiked in the past few months after the Indian government banned exports of non-basmati white rice in July to boost domestic supply and keep retail prices under check during the upcoming festive season.  ""Following the  export  ban, the prices of rice in Nepal have gone up. The rice that is sold here for Rs 15-20 per kilogram is being sold for as high as Rs 70 per kilogram in Nepal,"" claimed  Suraj  Jaiswal, a local rice trader who used to export rice to Nepal before the ban.  ""The smugglers pay these carriers up to Rs 300 for carrying a quintal of rice into Nepal. The remaining profits are pocketed by the smugglers. The carriers make as many trips into Nepal as possible in order to make more money,"" he said.  Due to rampant rice smuggling, local traders claimed, prices of rice here have also gone up over the last few months.  Ratan Lal Vaishy, an office-bearer of  Uttar Pradesh Udyog Vyapar Pratinidhi Mandal , said, ""Due to the increased smuggling of rice, its prices have increased.""  Before July, coarse rice was available at Rs 15 to 20 per kilogram but now it is being sold at Rs 30 to 35 per kilogram.  The price rise has forced district authorities to intensify efforts to check smuggling operations.  Maharajganj District Magistrate (DM) Anunaya Jha has deployed two six-member teams in Nautanwa and Nichaulal tehsils bordering Nepal to curb rice smuggling.  These teams were formed on October 3 and have been directed to provide daily reports on smuggling for further action.  ""Necessary guidelines have been issued to all concerned officials to curb smuggling in the border areas. We are also coordinating with SSB officials in the operations,"" Jha said.

Mishra also submitted that the apex bar body has to further verify if there is ""reciprocity"" of similar permission to practice for Indian nationals in South Korea.""This will open a floodgate,"" he argued, adding that this may later result in the entry of lawyers from Pakistan and Nepal into the country.A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sanjeev Narula, however, observed that Daeyoung Jung held a law degree from an Indian institute and was not a ""foreign lawyer"". The HC pointed out that law permitted him to practice in India if Indians were allowed to practice in his country and this aspect has been considered by the single judge.""Speaking for myself, I don't find anything wrong in the single judge's order,"" Justice Narula remarked as the bench gave six weeks' time to BCI to show that guidelines in South Korea do not permit Indians to practice there. ""If the South Korean government says Indians will be allowed, you have no case,"" the high court said.Earlier this year, the single judge had set aside BCI's refusal to accept a request by Jung, a citizen of South Korea, to enrol himself as an advocate in the country and directed the apex bar body to process his application as per law.The HC observed that Jung held a law degree from National Academy of Legal Studies and Research (NALSAR) in Hyderabad, which was duly recognised under the Advocates Act and entitled him to seek enrolment under the law.In its order, the single judge had noted that as per the legal framework under the Advocates Act, a national of any other country may also be admitted as an advocate and the right of enrolment of such a foreign national was subject only to the condition that duly qualified Indian citizens were also permitted to practice law in that other country."

In fact, completing the Seven Second Summits is considered a more difficult challenge than the Seven Summits—the highest peaks on each continent, a group that includes Everest and Denali. Very few male climbers have completed the Seven Second Summits—and until this year, no woman had. But on June 1, 2023, Jenn Drummond set a world record as the first (and only) woman to ever accomplish this feat with her successful summit of Mount Logan. The campaign began on December 16, 2020, with Ojos del Salado in Chile. Drummond then summited Mount Kenya in February 2021, Gora Dykh-Tau in September 2021, Mount Tyree in January 2022, K2 in July 2022 and Mount Townsend in November 2022. Drummond, who grew up in Holland, Michigan—elevation: 610 feet—is far from your typical climber. Before she moved to Park City, Utah, in 2015, she had never so much as slept in a tent. That changed in 2016 when a friend’s husband who was formerly a guide in the Grand Tetons took her on a climb there. “I fell in love with all aspects of it,” Drummond told me by phone in September, not long after she’d returned from her summit of Mount Logan. “I loved the quiet, loved the accomplishment, loved who you are when you go out versus who you are when you come home as an entirely different person.” Memories of that formative hiking trip would resurface two years later, in 2018, when Drummond was involved in a life-threatening car accident. A semi-truck collided with her Porsche Cayenne while she was traveling on a busy highway in Utah, causing her car to roll over three times before coming to a stop in the median. The rescue workers who came to Drummond’s aid were astonished to find that she was conscious, able to answer their questions and seemingly without any catastrophic injuries. Given the damange to her vehicle, they didn’t even know for sure that she would still be alive when the peeled back the windshield to reach her. Instead, five hours later, after getting checked out at the hospital, Drummond was walking through the door at home to her seven children. The following year, 2019, was a year of building up her bucket list. “I was putting anything I could think of on it,” Drummond said. “All of a sudden, I was afraid of dying. I was turning 40 in 2020, and I decided, ‘I’m gonna climb a mountain for my 40th birthday.’” Though she didn’t have experience in technical climbing, Drummond had been an athlete all her life and, growing up skiing, had spent plenty of time in altitude. Gymnastics gave her superior body awareness, while competing in triathlons built up her endurance. “You couldn’t pick a better background to get into mountaineering,” she said. Drummond began training to climb Ama Dablam in Nepal. (The peak was the inspiration for the Paramount

While she was helping her young son with his math homework, he expressed frustration at how difficult it was. “I told him, ‘We do hard things,’” Drummond said. “And then this child said to me, ‘Well, then why are you climbing this mountain called I’m a Dumb Blonde and not Everest?’ “Ama Dablam is harder than Everest, but he doesn’t know that,” Drummond added. “To him, the hardest mountain in the world is Everest. If I’m his mom and I do the hardest mountain in the world to him, that will show him he can do anything.” Drummond hired a coach, Alan Arnette, who recommended she read a book on training for uphill climbing. She read about a woman who’d set a Guinness World Record for skiing across the Alps and called her coach. “I was like, ‘Alan, I could have done that,’” Drummond said. “My kids learned how to read on Guinness World Records books,” Drummond said. “They do not think I’m cool. But I thought, ‘I would be the coolest mom in the whole world if I got into Guinness World Records. But I’m not growing pumpkins or speed-eating hot dogs.’ Alan called me back and he was like, ‘Jenn, I have the perfect world record—become the first woman to climb the Seven Second Summits.” Seven continents, seven mountains, seven children. “It sounded like a jackpot,” Drummond said. “If I look at my bucket list, I wanted to travel the world and also to empower women. It hasn’t been done, so if I fail, no big deal. No one else has done it either. I said yes, and we did it, girl.” It turned out that Everest would be a training climb for one of Drummond’s Seven Second Summits—K2, the second-highest peak in the world but also the deadliest. Per figures from 2018, about 23 percent of people who have attempted to summit K2 died. However, only a few hundred summit attempts have ever been made on K2, as opposed to more than 6,000 on Everest, which has a fatality rate of 4 percent. ""The Bottleneck"" on K2, the world's deadliest mountain, which Jenn Drummond successfully summited as ... [+] part of her quest to complete the Seven Second Summits. Some of the peaks are like hikes—you primarily just put one foot in front of the other until you reach the top. Mount Townsend in Australia was the easiest, Drummond said. “Mount Kenya is a 20-pitch rock climb; you need rock shoes, a harness, ice axes, crampons,” Drummond said. “If you’re not a climber, you’re not getting up Mount Kenya.” And climbing K2, especially at the higher altitudes, “is like playing Frogger,” Drummond said. “It throws rocks at you the entire time you’re climbing. They’re tiny rocks, like the little rocks in a fishtank, but it’s like a bullet. I have friends who got hit; it would rip through three layers of clothing and they’d have to get stitches.” To go from a woman who had never so much as hiked until she was in her thirties to a woman who was able to complete the Seven Second Summits is an enormous feat—physically, mentally and financially. Mountaineering is not cheap, and if there’s one thing Drummond regrets about her campaign, it’s that she didn’t fight harder to secure sponsor funding. While the financial support would have been nice, Drummond said, what she really would have liked is more bandwidth for the story. “The things that happened from stepping into the pursuit are so amazing that you want more people to have the courage to step into their pursuit,” Drummond said. She shared that she got denied by one of the first sponsors she reached out to because she’s a mom of seven—the implication being that she wouldn’t successfully summit. “And I failed K2 the first time,” Drummond said. “A teammate died in an avalance, another lost his hand to frostbite, another injured his leg. Another team came up to me and said, ‘Do you want to continue with our team? Because your team is going down.’ I’m not climbing this mountain with a new team. I’m gonna take care of my team; you take care of your people.” When she returned from that trip, her children asked, “Mom, did you summit?” The answer: “No, but I had success.” “I had the opportunity to summit or to show up as a good human and I showed up as a good human, and I’m proud of myself for that,” Drummond said. “Who we are is more important than what we achieve.” To that point, when Drummond returned to Pakistan for her second summit attempt of K2 in 2022, she met a Pakistani woman who was looking to summit the famed peak. “I summited as the third American female on the top of K2. Cool, right?” Drummond said. “Cooler is that the first Pakistani female stood on top of her country’s prized peak. She’s telling 10-year-old Muslim girls, ‘We have opportunities.’ “I think I failed on purpose the first time so that I could make more possible.” Jenn Drummond holding a picture of her family on the summit of K2, one of her successful Seven ... [+] Second Summits The climbs taught Drummond about the importance of showing up authentically, especially as a woman in predominantly male spaces. A funny example that also serves to make the larger point is that when Drummond, who has long, blonde hair, was interviewing climbing companies, she asked about the possibility of using a hair dryer at base camp—so that her hair didn’t freeze. “The first company was like, ‘What are you talking about?’” Drummond said. “The second company was like, ‘You could use the generator once a week.’ The third company said, ‘Yes, and do you want a mirror?’ “If you can anticipate my next need, that’s who I want on the mountain,” Drummond said, jokingly referring to herself as Mountain Barbie. “A week after the climb, we were all back in Kathmandu, and some of the women came up to me and said, ‘Thank you for drying your hair at base camp; thank you for taking up space as a female and helping us own our femininity in a masculine environment.’ So often if we just do what we need and own who we are, things happen and we just empower others around us.” Inspired by her experiences on the Seven Second Summits, Drummond wrote a book called Breakproof: 7 Strategies to Build Resilience and Achieve Your Life Goals. It’s available for pre-order now with a release date of Jan. 9, 2024. “The reason why I share this story is because I look at my life five years ago before that car accident, and my mindset was always, ‘If, then.’ ‘When my kids get older, then I can do this.’ I want the book to be a permission slip for you to own who you are. I added the word ‘and’ to my life. I’m a mom and a mountaineer and an entrepreneur.” So, now do her kids think she’s cool? “No,” Drummond said, laughing. “I’m a normal, everyday human,” Drummond said. “I wasn’t genetically gifted, I didn’t come from a silver-spoon upbringing. I want people to be like, ‘If she did that, I can.’”"

A new survey finds the gender gap in 'home cooking' has widened, with women cooking more meals than men in nearly every country worldwide. Women cooked just under nine meals per week, on average, in 2022. Men cooked about four per week. These are the results of an annualsurvey by Gallup and Cookpad, which tracks how often people prepare and eat home-cooked meals in countries around the globe. When the survey began in 2018, traditional gender roles were well established, but during the pandemic years the survey results showed that men were cooking more. This narrowed the gender gap, explains Andrew Dugan, a research director at Gallup, who has worked on the survey since it began. ""Every year since the study started, the gap narrowed,"" he says. Until now. The latest results, which Duggan says come as a surprise, point to a reversal of this trend. In 2022, women continued to cook at about the same frequency, but men started to cook less. On average, men cooked a little less than one fewer meal per week. ""It's the first year that the gap actually widened,"" Dugan says, pointing out that the gap has reverted back to its starting point in 2018. ""What it might suggest is [that] the traditional gender roles are starting to reassert themselves,"" Dugan says. The gender gap varies by country. In the United States, women cook about two more meals per week on average, than men.  The survey report graphs the countries with the largest gender gaps, including Ethiopia, Tajikistan, Egypt, Nepal and Yemen, where women are making about eight more meals per week than men. The countries with the smallest gender differences in cooking are clustered in Europe, including Spain, the UK, Switzerland, France, and Ireland. There's only one country where men actually cook more than women. Wait for it..... Italy.  ""This is a surprise,"" Dugan says. It's not clear why Italy bucked the trend,  or why the gender gap widened in all the other countries including the U.S., but chef Mike Friedman, who operates several restaurants in the Washington D.C. area, has his take. ""I think woman can handle more on their plate,"" he says. In the U.S.,  where women cook about two more meals per week than men, Friedman thinks the survey may not capture the whole picture. He says in his house, lots of meals  are collaborations. ""I know in my own home my wife does a lot of the cooking. But we talk about it and we talk through 'what should we make tonight?' And a lot of times she'll start and I'll finish and then I'm always left with the dishes,"" Friedman says. That got us thinking: How do you divide meal prep in your household and who does the lion's share? Are there any tensions in your household about who makes dinner, and how did you resolve them?

US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement Monday, ""At this time, we can confirm the deaths of nine US citizens."" He said there are ""unaccounted-for US citizens, and we are working with our Israeli partners to determine their whereabouts."" Meanwhile the BBC reported on Monday that more than 10 Britons are also feared dead or missing in the occupied territories. UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said he would not speculate on the number of British or dual nationals in the region. France also said two of its nationals have been killed. A lawmaker representing French nationals overseas, Meyer Habib, said on Monday that ""at least eight"" French people had been killed, captured or were missing. Dozens of other nationals have also been reportedly killed, including people from Thailand, Nepal, Ukraine, France, Canada and Cambodia. Hamas launched Operation al-Aqsa Storm on Saturday. It has been without precedent in scale. Israeli media outlets say more than 800 settlers and troops have been killed as a result of the operation. Some 2,560 Israelis have also been injured. Israel on Monday stepped up attacks on the Gaza Strip and imposed a total siege on the densely populated enclave.  "

I said please kill her because it would be better than being kidnapped,” Ben, whose surname CNN is not using for security concerns, said on Wednesday. “It’s a nightmare. I said ‘please kill her, don’t take her there.’” Over WhatsApp, he watched, helpless, as his mother and younger brother sent updates for eight hours, telling him that they were hiding in small bushes, hearing gunfire and people walking past saying “Allahu Akbar.” “(Every message) took about two minutes to arrive and in between there was no communication,” he said. “Every two minutes you are tearing your hair out to get an answer.” Israel is at war with Hamas. Here's what to know Eventually, Ben heard of a secure location, sent the map to his brother and they managed to escape from the festival. The next morning, Ben flew to Israel from London where he lives with his British wife and children. He is one ofmanyIsraelis returning home from abroad as their country’slong-running conflict with Hamas escalates into a warnot seen on this scale for a generation. To cope with the increasing demand, Israeli airlines El Al, Israir and Arkia added more flights on Tuesday to repatriate military reservists,Reuters reported. Cutting short holidays or uprooting their everyday lives overseas, these Israelis are returning for funerals, in preparation for being called up into the military reserves, carrying supplies back with them, or to help protect their communities. At least 1,200 people have been killed in Israel followingHamas’ deadly and brutal attackon October 7 when its militants broke through the heavily fortified border from Gaza, leaving atrocities in their wake. Gaza crisis grows under intense bombardment as Israel retaliates to Hamas atrocities Israel has responded byhammering Gazawith airstrikes and halting supplies of electricity, food, water and fuel to the Palestinian enclave. At least 1,417 people have been killed in Gaza in the days since, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and the enclave’s onlypower station ran out of fuelon Wednesday. Straight after seeing his family when he landed in Israel, Ben went to Lod, a city about nine miles southeast of Tel Aviv, where there had previously been outbursts of violence. There he joined friends in forming an impromptu neighborhood watch, to ensure the situation remained calm. He has since helped to deliver donated food and is planning to drive to the south of the country as there aren’t enough drivers to take people to their families. “At least there’s something that I can do,” he said. “I couldn’t stay in London and just watch it all happening on TV.” Another returning Israeli is 30-year-old Guy, who works in cybersecurity and has lived in London for the last five years. CNN is not using his surname for safety reasons. Guy traveled back to Israel on Wednesday after learning that six of his friends were missing after attending the Supernova music festival. Two of the group have since been confirmed dead. He told CNN that he is returning to be a military reservist, and for the funerals of his friends, who were part of a “close circle” that often went to trance music festivals, like Supernova, alongside Palestinians too. “The generation born since the Yom Kippur War have never seen anything like this,” he said. “They have had the opportunity to believe in peace and the two-state solution… we grew up with that… The people that go to these festivals participate as citizens of the world who essentially just want to celebrate life.” In Israel, 'the place where you want your kids to grow up' has suddenly turned into the front line Israel has called up 300,000 reservists to fight for its military, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson, Maj. Doron Spielman told CNN Wednesday, a mobilization on the scale of a major country such as the United States, despite Israel’s relatively small population of 9.7 million, according to data from the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics in April. “There’s not a family that does not have somebody that’s been called up. Or, unfortunately, since we’re such a small country, a family that does not have friends, or loved ones that are still missing,” Spielman told CNN. Though there are some exemptions, every Israeli citizen over the age of 18 is required to serve in the IDF. After finishing their service, many take lengthy trips overseas, a kind of post-service rite of passage. After completing his military service, 22-year-old Ben, who also asked to keep his family name confidential, had intended to explore Asia for several months. But heabandoned those planson Saturday when he learned of Hamas’ attack while in a mountain village in Nepal. He has since returned to Israel and is on standby to serve as a reservist in a reconnaissance unit. In a telephone call from Nepal on Monday, prior to his flight on Tuesday, Ben said he thought there were more than 100 Israelis in Kathmandu alone trying to return. “It feels really hard to be so far away and there isn’t much you can do,” he said. “You’re worried about the people there and all you do all day is watch the news and look at your phone. It’s impossible to be away right now.” Ilan Fisher, 29, is another Israeli expecting to be called up for reserve duty, he told CNN on Wednesday. He was on vacation in Melbourne, Australia on the day of Hamas’ attack, attending the wedding of two close Australian friends, both of whom also live in Israel. Though Fisher has had multiple offers to remain in Melbourne, he intends to fly back on Sunday and expects to be drafted back into the army’s media department. “Given the situation there right now, how dire it is and how dire it will be, I don’t really have another choice but to go back,” he said. Some Israelis are rushing back for other reasons. Rachel Gold, 27, had been on vacation in Toronto and had the idea of taking supplies back to Israel with her friend, Jessica Kane, who had been visiting her parents in New York. After putting out a call on social media, they raised $15,000 to buy supplies and flew back on Monday evening with two other friends, carrying 13 large check-in cases, four carry-on bags and several backpacks with them. The luggage was stuffed with supplies including head torches, flashlights, underwear, socks, toothbrushes, portable chargers, hydration pouches and protein bars. Kane, 26, told CNN that her family are religiously observant and so she did not hear of the attack until her father learned of it by word of mouth while in synagogue. “Initially I didn’t believe it. I thought it was being sensationalized,” she said. “We very quickly went on our phones. I had a few missed calls from the army and had a million red alert notifications about missiles falling. It was incredibly, incredibly difficult.” The friends were met at the airport on Tuesday by volunteers who immediately took the donations to deliver to the south of Israel. Gold is now on a military base in the south, having been recruited as a reservist. “Being here is a lot more comforting than being away,” she told CNN. “I felt desperately helpless just sitting at home watching the news and thinking what else I can do beyond sending money. Being here at least I feel part of it and taking action and doing things, plus I’m not glued to the news all day. Being here is a little bit less scary than being abroad.” CNN’s Niamh Kennedy and Abeer Salman contributed to this report."

Following days of torrential rain in the northeastern state of Sikkim, torrents of water swept down narrow river valleys from Lohnak Lake, in the northern part of the state, damaging a dam and wreaking destruction in villages and Rangpo town, about 50 km (30 miles) south of state capital Gangtok. Rescuers have found 25 bodies in the state and bodies of eight army personnel were found in the neighboring downstream state of West Bengal, Sikkim’s chief secretary Vijay Bhushan Pathak told Reuters. He said 101 people were still missing in the latest of a series of natural disasters caused by extreme weather events in the Himalayas. Fourteen army personnel were among the missing, a defense ministry statement said. The search for survivors was hampered by damaged roads, poor communications and bad weather, and residents were struggling to clear sludge and debris in the wake of one of the worst disasters in the remote region in more than 50 years. Parveen Shama, the top district official of Jalpaiguri in West Bengal, said 41 bodies were found in the district. Sikkim, a Buddhist state of 650,000 people wedged in the mountains between Nepal, Bhutan and China, received 101 millimeters (four inches) of rain in the first five days of October, more than double normal levels. Lhonak Lake is a large glacial bullet-shaped water body that sits at the foot of a melting glacier. An analysis of the images shows more than 60% of the water held in the lake drained out after the extreme rainstorm triggered aglacial lake outburst.This phenomenon happens when a glacial lake rises too high or the surrounding land or ice gives way and the lake bursts, sending water and debris rushing down mountains. Scientists have long studied Lhonak Lake, identifying it as one of the fastest swelling glacial lakes in the region with a high risk for a potential glacial outburst, according tomultiple studies. Mukesh Kumar, a 43-year-old migrant worker in Rangpo, described how he and his neighbors had barely 10 minutes to escape before the flash flood hit. “Had we not left for another two minutes, we might have drowned,” said Kumar, staring at the sludge and debris covering his lodgings. Residents told Reuters that many people whose dwellings were on the ground floor could not have survived. Baiju Sharma, 45, who ran a furniture business, surveyed the aftermath of the disaster. “Where you are standing is 15 feet (4.5 meters) higher than earlier. You are standing on his house,” Sharma said, pointing towards his neighbor. Government officials said about 2,000 tourists stuck in cut off areas of northern Sikkim were reported to be safe, and state authorities and the army had provided them with food and communication facilities to contact their families. Known as the rooftop of the world, the ecologically sensitive Himalayan region is prone to flash floods and landslides, and flooding is not unusual in Sikkim. But scientists are clear that extreme weather is becomingmore frequent and more intenseas the human-caused climate crisis accelerates.

A  Nepal Airlines  wide-body aircraft, which flew to Tel Aviv on Thursday morning to bring back the Nepali students, landed in Kathmandu at around 3 am (Local Time) on Friday. Leading the rescue mission, NP Saud, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Himalayan Nation announced the arrival of 254 students in the first batch of evacuation while 249 still wait back in Israel for airlift. ""The  Nepal Embassy  in Tel Aviv had earlier registered Nepali citizens who wanted to be located in safer areas and those wanting to return back to Nepal. Till now a total of 557 Nepali citizens have registered themselves, of which 503 wanted to return to Nepal and of them a total of 254 students have been evacuated under the first phase of evacuation efforts,"" said Saud while addressing media persons here at the airport on Friday morning. ""Currently in Tel Aviv commercial flights are commencing on a daily basis. The students whom we couldn't accommodate during this evacuation, on the basis of need, the Government of Nepal will make arrangements for their return,"" the Foreign Minister added. Students were seen hugging and embracing their families and relatives as they arrived back in Kathmandu with a feeling of relief but minds full of ordeal. The killing of 10 students working as interns under the ""learn and earn"" scheme of the Israeli government, by the terror group  Hamas  has left everyone there shattered. ""We were having our lunch, then suddenly we got a high alert message, after which we ran towards the bunker, we ran for life leaving all the work. We stayed in the bunker for 2 days, as it wasn't that safe for us, we then shifted to the community bunker where we stayed for about 25 hours. Though the bunker was guarded by the army it wasn't deemed secured as we were running short of supplies. We tried relocating ourselves but the condition developed alike everywhere,"" Krishna Acharya, one of the evacuees who stayed in Northern Israel told as he waited for his luggage to arrive. Another evacuee  Sobha  Paswan who worked at a nursery in Israel had to undergo the same ordeal of drying out supplies and fear of getting bombed. ""On the first day of the war we were really scared, spent the first day in full of fear, we were running out of supplies, we had food only once and we didn't get out of the bunker for a whole 24 hours. We were advised to stay inside and the sirens kept on rising followed by the missile. After completing two rounds of clocks we were advised to go washroom, within less than 5 minutes we again had to rush back to the bunker. A total of 18 people were confined in that tiny bunker."" As the war between Israel and Hamas continues to enter its 6th day, the whereabouts of one Nepali student are yet to be ascertained. Officials at the  Foreign Ministry  stated that a search is underway utilising all possible measures. Dhan Bahadur Chaudhary, who was injured in an attack by Hamas, also arrived back in Nepal taking support of a wheelchair in the same batch of evacuees. The latest move of the Nepal government comes in the wake of the death of 10 students from Nepal in Kibbutz near the Gaza border after Hamas terrorists opened fire on them on Saturday (October 7). The Nepal government on Sunday confirmed the death of the students, who were in Israel under a 10-month internship in the agricultural sector.  ""Since day one of the ongoing conflict, I was in close contact with my daughter, and her reaction at the time of conversation always scared us. We used to contact her on an hourly basis, in case she was not online or didn't reply to us we used to get really scared and worried for her. We only would settle after seeing her over the virtual video call. After she got on the evacuation plane in Tel Aviv the worries about her ended,"" said Ganesh Kumar Sharma, a family member of one of the evacuees.

We are also seeing a longer  festival season  with Diwali in mid-November. We have a good 40-45-day period when good sales can come in and therefore we are still quite positive on Q3 and therefore we expect to get back to the double digit  volume growth  in Q3.” ET Now : Volume growth numbers came in at around 6% for Q2 while the Street was expecting 8-9% growth in terms of volumes. Are you still maintaining the double-digit guidance that you have given in terms of the volume growth of the company?  Unlock Leadership Excellence with a Range of CXO Courses Offering College Course Website IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Executive Officer Programme Visit Indian School of Business ISB Chief Digital Officer Visit IIM Lucknow IIML Chief Operations Officer Programme Visit So, overall yes, for this quarter we got a 6% volume growth. The CAGR levels if you see are still at about 15% over a four-year period. So, overall, the demand was a little depressed in this quarter in terms of what we saw, especially in the month of July where there was very heavy rainfall and progressively seen August and September there was some improvement and we exited at fairly healthy rates in September as we see in terms of overall performance to that extent.  We definitely see some benefit of deferred demand which will come in Q3. We are also seeing a longer festival season with Diwali in mid-November. We have a good 40-45-day period when good sales can come in and therefore we are still quite positive on Q3 and therefore we expect to get back to the double digit volume growth in Q3. Last time you had mentioned that the performance was aided by rural recovery. What trends are you witnessing right now when it comes to the rural and urban regions? During Q2, we have seen that tier I and tier II cities have grown at a higher pace as compared to T3, T4. This is a little bit of a reversal of a trend which we were seeing in Q1 where we were seeing equal growth coming from both urban and rural centres. But in this quarter, we definitely see that in rural centres, demand has been depressed.  We are also seeing a little bit of downgrading in the T3, T4 cities overall towards that extent and that is another phenomenon which we see. Overall, the B2B business has been fairly good in terms of what we have been able to achieve. Whether it is the institutional sales or industrial sales, both have performed quite well in this quarter overall to that extent. So, from the overall demand trends we see this is the general area in terms of how the demand has proceeded.  You Might Also Like: Asian Paints Q2 numbers weak, demand should pick up from Q3: Preeyam Tolia It was subdued a little bit because of the erratic rainfall as we have seen and also because of the fact that today we are looking at a longer festival season ahead so there is some deferment of demand. In crude prices, a surge is seen coming in. Will you be taking any price hikes now? Overall, we have seen a deflation of about 2% in Q1 in terms of raw material prices and a deflation of 3-4% in Q2 as well. The geopolitical situation is now worsening and we have seen a hike in terms of the crude prices. So depending on how inflation behaves, there is reason to believe that material prices will start going up by 1-1.5% in this quarter. So, we will calibrate our prices going forward. We need to get a sense in terms of where the inflation is going going ahead from the point of view of material prices. Apart from crude, will the margin pressure also stem from increased competition given the fact that Grasim will also be launching its product by the end of this calendar year? We have given our margin guidance at the PBIT levels of 18% to 20% and we stick to that guidance from the beginning of the year. Overall, I have always maintained that there has been competition in the market for the last 20 years. Overall so many players have launched in the last three to four years that we do not see any pressures coming in terms of any new players entering the business because the brand is fairly strong and the supply chains trends are also equally strong for taking us ahead. We do not see any disruption happening from the point of view of any margins or any other demand which is going to get hit because of any entry of another player. In terms of your international business, we are seeing headwinds coming in and challenges from the macroeconomic front, in terms of currency depreciation and devaluations coming in in some of the regions. What is the outlook there? We feel that the global market is responding slowly. We have done well in the Middle East market and parts of Africa which is Ethiopia; however, the overall market in Asia has been hit very strongly, especially markets of Nepal and Bangladesh. Bangladesh and Egypt are also witnessing strong depreciation in terms of their currencies overall to that extent. We feel that the global markets will be slow to recover and we are not seeing an immediate recovery happening in Q3 in terms of the global markets.

Another eight Thai nationals have been injured in the violence since Saturday, said Thailand's foreign ministry. It said air force planes were on standby to fly its citizens home.  There are some 30,000 Thais in Israel working in agriculture, many near the Gaza border. Nepal said 10 of its citizens had been killed. Other countries which have reported citizens killed, abducted or missing in the violence in Israel include the US, UK and Germany. Thailand's labour minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn told AFP news agency that some 5,000 Thai labourers work in the zone where fighting has been taking place, but that Israeli forces had begun moving them to safety. He added that 1,099 workers have registered to return home.  Workers at a farm in Mivtahim, a town near the Gaza Strip, described Hamas militants storming their farm after rockets were fired in the early hours of Saturday. ""The Hamas militants fired a rocket first, then they stormed our farm. I had to run and hide in my bedroom,"" Udomporn Champahom told the BBC.   Mr Udomporn was later rescued by Israeli soldiers. He said that a fellow Thai who was with him at the time is recovering from a gunshot wound ""as big as a bottle cap"" on his leg. Another Thai worker told the BBC: ""I was running and crawling underneath a truck then the Hamas pulled me out and pointed the gun at me at point blank before firing to the ground."" The worker, who declined to be named, later managed to escape. Wanida Maarsa told BBC Thai that her husband Anucha Angkaew - who had been working on an avocado farm for almost two years - was one of those taken captive by the militants.  He appeared in a video Hamas put out over the weekend. ""[The man in the video] is absolutely him,"" she said.  ""I have not been able to contact him since 02:00 Bangkok time [19:00 GMT on Friday]. I talked to him just before our daughter went to sleep,"" Ms Wanida added. More than 50 countries are thought to have citizens working inside Israel. Nepal confirmed on Sunday that the 10 students who were killed had gone to Israel to work and acquire skills in an agricultural firm.  One of the victims was 27-year-old Rajesh Kumar Swarnakar, whose family are in mourning in their village Madhuwan in eastern Sunsari district. Rajesh was a final year agriculture student who hoped to go to Australia, his brother Mukesh told BBC Nepali. ""I was not in favour of sending my brother to Israel. He insisted to us that he had received a scholarship and told us that he would save some money to apply for Australia after finishing the programme in Israel."" Their father Raj Kumar Swarnakar felt the Israeli authorities had been negligent in sending his son for training in an area prone to conflict.  In total Nepal says 265 of its students are working on various Israeli farms.  Seventeen students from Nepal's Far Western University were attacked by Hamas gunmen near Gaza. As well as the 10 killed, four are being treated at local hospitals and two have been rescued to Tel Aviv. One is still missing.  The Nepali embassy in Israel has said more than 200 Nepalese have filled out forms expressing a willingness to return home. In addition to those working in agriculture, another 4,500 Nepalis are reported to be working as caregivers in Israel.  Separately, India said that it is working ""actively"" to bring back its nationals in Israel. According to media reports, there are around 18,000 Indians living and working in the country.

Shishapangma, at just over 8,000m, is the world's 14th tallest peak. It is widely regarded as one of the easier mountains of that height, known among climbers as the ""eight-thousanders"". Two avalanches hit its slopes at elevations of 7,600m and 8,000m on Saturday (Oct 7), killing American climber Anna Gutu and Nepalese guide Mingmar Sherpa, Xinhua reported. Another American climber, Gina Marie Rzucidlo, and her Nepalese guide, Tenjen Sherpa, were missing. Tenjen Sherpa was the guide for Norway's Kristin Harila when they climbed K2 in Pakistan in July tobecome the world's fastest climbers to scale all 14 peaks over 8,000m. Another Nepalese guide Karma, Geljen Sherpa, was seriously hurt on Saturday but was escorted down the mountain by rescuers. A total of 52 climbers were pushing for the summit when the avalanches hit, including from the United States, Britain, Romania, Albania, Italy, Japan and Pakistan, Xinhua said. All climbing activity on Shishapangma was suspended due to the unstable snow conditions. Two Pakistani climbers narrowly escaped the avalanches on Saturday after calling off their summit bid because of poor weather despite coming within a few hundred metres of the peak, Pakistani media reported. Had one of the Pakistani climbers, Sirbaz Khan, reached the top of Shishapangma he would have become the first Pakistani to summit all 14 mountains over 8,000m. More than 300 successful summits of Shishapangma have been logged to date, with under 10 per cent of climbers who tried to reach the top dying in their attempts, according to private estimates. That compares with the nearly 30 per cent fatality rate for Nepal's Annapurna I, one of the world's most dangerous peaks. Among those who had previously died on Shishapangma was famed American climber Alex Lowe in 1999, also because of an avalanche. His body as well as the remains of his climbing companion David Bridges were found in 2016 in a partially melted glacier. October is a popular month for climbers in the Himalayas due to its traditionally more stable conditions as monsoon rain eases. But scientists warn that global warming is raising avalanche risks in high-altitude regions including the Himalayas. Last week, a Chinese expedition set up a series of weather stations on the 8,201-metre Cho Oyu on Tibet's border with Nepal tomeasure the impact of climate change in the Himalayas."

However, a number of Chinese projects in  Nepal  exist only on paper, in stark contrast to projects funded by  India  in the Himalayan country, where India’s grant assistance to Nepal totals around $63 billion, ET has learnt. Prachanda visited China late last month and reportedly got assurance of funding for 12 projects, even as there has been little progress on projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) projects in Nepal, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Nepal signed the BRI agreement with China in 2017. However, the country has yet to reap the benefits of the agreement, even as some Nepalese leaders sought Chinese funds to reduce dependence on India. China has raised the issue of delayed BRI projects with Nepalese leaders, but there is no clarity as to why the projects have been delayed, according to Nepal watchers. Some of the projects were added to the BRI at the insistence of some Nepalese leaders, they said. In contrast, since 2018, including during the Covid-19 pandemic, India-backed projects have either been completed or are nearing completion. From border check-posts to healthcare services to road-rail links and power projects, India has launched projects across sectors in the neighbouring country. India’s concessional line of credit to Nepal amounts to $1.65 billion for 22 projects. Besides, the High Impact Community Development Projects programme has been extended up to Rs 3.125 crore per project in critical sectors, including health, education and community infrastructure development. The Indian funded projects that have been completed include integrated check posts at Birgunj and Biratnagar; Motihari-Amlekhgunj petroleum products pipeline; Terai roads project; and Jayanagar-Kurtha-BijalpuraBardibas rail link, two phases of which have been completed and work on the third phase is continuing. Other India-backed projects in Nepal include Jogbani-Biratnagar rail link, 900 MW Arun-III Hydro Electric Project and post-earthquake reconstruction works across housing, education and cultural heritage sectors.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a news briefing in Beijing that China firmly opposes actions that expand the conflict and undermine regional stability. Beijing hopes for a cease-fire, an end to the conflict and the resumption of peace talks as soon as possible, she added. Mao called on the international community to effectively play its role and work together to cool down the situation. On Monday, Israel's military scoured the country's south for Hamas fighters, guarded breaches in its border fence with tanks and pounded the Gaza Strip from the air. Israel vowed to lay total siege to the impoverished, Hamas-ruled territory in the wake of an unprecedented weekend incursion, and said it had brought in special forces to wrest control of four sites from Hamas fighters. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Sunday that the country was ""in a state of war"" and asked Israelis to prepare for a ""long and difficult"" conflict. In response, China had urged relevant parties to remain calm, exercise restraint and immediately end the hostilities to protect civilians and avoid further escalation of the situation. The fighting continued in several locations on Monday morning. At least 800 people have reportedly been killed in Israel — a staggering toll on a scale the country has not experienced in decades — and more than 560 have been killed in the Gaza Strip. The conflict has had a global impact, with several countries reporting their nationals killed, abducted or missing. At least nine United States citizens were killed in the conflict, the US State Department said on Monday in a statement, adding that an undetermined number of US citizens remain missing and unaccounted for. Thailand said at least 12 of its nationals were killed, while Nepal reported 10 deaths. They were all laborers working in Israel. The United Nations said on Monday that more than 123,000 people have been displaced in Gaza since the fresh round of violence erupted on Saturday. AGENCIES VIA XINHUA  "

They acquired IDFC Mutual Fund Business, which is now Bandhan Mutual Fund. So now going forward, I would not be surprised if we see quarter on quarter, their net interest margins jumping sharply because they have got enough money to give out, enough credit offtake, which they can do with the raw material they have on their books. ” What has been keeping you busy in terms of portfolio allocation? How have you changed? What have you allocated? What have you subtracted in the last three months? I have not done things very differently. It is the same stocks that we are holding and buying more of, which I have spoken about many times. The same ITC, Infosys, Coal India, ONGC, Lupin. We have just added two more stocks. In fact, added one more and initiated coverage on the other one. One is Bandhan Bank because I was going through their financials and it is a very unique bank because most other banking stocks, banking sector in general, you will see the credit offtake is usually very high compared to their deposits growth. This is one bank where deposits are growing really rapidly. And their credit offtake, their lending is not growing as fast. I think the reason is they probably wanted to maintain much cash on their books because the company has done a lot.

Also, valuation-wise, it is amazingly cheap compared to most of the other banking stocks. It is right now available at a price to earnings in multiple of 19. And most of the businesses they have added, will also start generating revenue. So that is one stock which I am having in my portfolio, all client portfolios. Everywhere we have portfolios, you will see we have added Bandhan Bank. The other stock that I am looking at is  Panacea Biotech . It is a very interesting company. In pre-Covid days, they had a lot of debt on their books. Around Covid, they restructured the company. They have paid off all their debt. It is a debt-free company. They got out of low production markets like India and Nepal, which is where they did their portfolio immunization. And now they are focusing more on developing nations.  In Africa, they have patented their polio vaccination in 30 countries. Their big clients are the Government of India, UNICEF, and the Pan American Health Organization. Their order book stands at Rs 1040 crore. That is one stock that I really like.  So, these are the only two stocks that I am looking at. But broadly, to answer your question, I meet clients and they are very eager to add stocks into their portfolios because stock markets have done phenomenally well. What I tell them is that, keep maintaining a balance between the money you have in your fixed income products, in your banks, and what you are investing in stocks. To the extent you have incremental money coming in, have an allocation mix and keep dividing it equally. So, I have not done very much differently in the last few months.

All that is now changing as it undergoes a rapid makeover, symbolically ushering in a cultural renaissance. Ayodhya is one of seven holy cities where a temple to Lord Rama, the hero of the Hindu mythological epicRamayana, is situated. The temple stands at what is considered to be his birthplace. From 1986, the site was the eye ofpolitical-legal storms. Some believe it was originally the venue for a Hindu temple that was demolished to construct a mosque known as Babri Masjid. Muslims claim that the land was titled to them and the mosque was built here in 1528 on the orders of the first Mughal emperor, Babur. However, the controversy ended with a Supreme Courtdecisionin 2019 that ordered the disputed land to be given for the construction of a Hindu temple, while the Muslim side would be compensated with five acres of land at a prominent site in Ayodhya to build a mosque. Construction of Ram temple began thereafter, and it is due to be open for worship in early 2024.  Its preeminence as a sought-after destination for Hindu pilgrims is on the horizon amid a massive infrastructure push for its makeover, or as the Hindus might say, its reincarnation. A sprawlingfaith economyis in the works in this underdeveloped and impoverished eastern region of UP, where joblessness and crime have been rampant. Erstwhile government apathy, deep-rooted corruption, and blind faith led to social maladies, locals alleged. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to change that age-old narrative. According to the temple town’s residents, the transformation is powered by a “double-engine” Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government initiative – with Modi at the federal level and backed by Yogi Adityanath, the Hindu monk-turned-UP chief minister in his second consecutive term. Amit Singh, additional district magistrate (executive) of Ayodhya, said the state government is placing emphasis on urban planning to transform the temple town and its adjoining areas – the district known as Faizabad till 2018, and now known as Ayodhya – into a leading spiritual hub. “Work is in progress at a breakneck speed to cater to an uptick in tourist footfall in line with the newmaster plan2031. The three main thoroughfares of the town are being widened between 20 and 14 meters to ease traffic congestion and the work is likely to be completed by December,”Singh said. “The remaining road extension projects near the Ram temple will be completed by early 2024. Altogether, 35 new parking centers are being built. The main railhead, Ayodhya Junction, is being beautified and the under-construction station resembles the Rama temple. Around 35 historic ‘kunds’ (ponds) are also being restored. All the buildings’ facades in the town will sport a uniform color scheme such as saffron,”added Singh. On October 3, the UP government pledged that all clearances and compliance certificates would be given to private players planning to open hotels cashing in on the pilgrims’ progress within a stipulated time frame of 100 days. Currently, only 30-odd facilities along with a few charitable inns and homestays exist. “Ayodhya Housing Development Board has acquired 600 acres of land, where guest houses of state governments such as Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Rajasthan, who have shown interest till date, will be built,”Singh said, giving the interest a pan-Indian sweep. “Plans are afoot to woo non-resident Indians (NRIs) with attractions like a solar cruise on the Sarayu River, a helicopter service, golf carts, a food court and a tent city on the banks of the Sarayu,”he said. “A mobile application has been developed by the Ayodhya Development Authority for these services. Electric buses and charging facilities are also being planned as sustainable and green energy initiatives.” Work is also in progress on the Delhi-VaranasiHigh-Speed Rail Projectvia Ayodhya, which will cut travel down to two hours from the current ten.  Ayodhya Dham, a radius of around 8km around the temple town that prohibits non-vegetarian food and alcohol, looks like a war zone with JCBs, road rollers, blockades, and barricades strewn all around. Work is at a frenetic pace to meet the deadline of the shrine’s consecration – when the idol of Ram Lalla will be installed at the temple, on January 22, in the presence of Modi. Later, the shrine will be open to the public. The BJP’s Girish Pati Tripathi, mayor of Ayodhya Municipal Corporation and a former chief priest of the town’s Teen Kalash Tiwari temple, pointed out that the UP government would foot 60% of the Rs 320-billion ($3.85 billion)costthat is earmarked for the town’s growth and development, while the other 40% would be paid by the federal government. “The ongoing infrastructure boom has led to employment opportunities for laborers from the neighboring districts,”Tripathi said.“We are catering to around 200,000 pilgrims daily, despite the existing infrastructure inadequacies. Many of these pilgrims are from neighboring districts and come for a day’s visit. However, the annual footfall is likely to go up to 40 million in the coming years.” Tripathi recalled that Ayodhya became South Korea’s Gimhae’s sister city in 2000 because of anhistorical connection. Ashraf Hafeez, who plies a battery-driven three-wheeler during the day and retails clothes in the evening at a local marketplace, is looking forward to the “good times.”He returned to his hometown from Mumbai a decade ago, and attributes his decision to divine intervention. “I’m convinced that my impulsive decision was guided by Lord Rama’s wishes, as faith can move mountains. I could become one of the beneficiaries of an imminent economic boom,” he said. A resident of Amaniganj, on the periphery of Ayodhya Dham, Ashraf demolished a part of his house to allow the widening of a thoroughfare. He anticipates an“economic boom.” The construction of the first phase of the Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram International Airport, located on the city’s outskirts, for the domestic sector is to be completed by the end of October and flights are likely to be operational by December. “This will be a record for a brownfield project’s completion within 19 months. Earlier, we had an air strip of 1,500 meters. We’ll apply for a license from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. So far, air operators have applied for seven routes. Initially, the terminal will have a capacity to handle 500 passengers during peak hours,”said Rajeev Kulshrestha, general manager of the Airport Authority of India. After the first phase, attention would be turned to the next two phases, including starting international flights. Operations are likely to be extended to the Buddhist pilgrim circuit in Lumbini in neighboring Nepal, and also to Sri Lanka. Similarly, Indian Railways has started a train service known as Sri Ramayana Yatra, which covers the sacred places associated with the life of Lord Rama including anextended optional tripto Sri Lanka. Ayodhya’s potential economic boom is attracting private investors. Sunil Rastogi, whose family has been in the local jewelry business for generations, decided to get into the hospitality sector even before plans of the temple’s construction came to fruition. “There was not a single standard hotel in the town,”Rastogi said.“We had a prime property called Swayambar Lawn let out for weddings, birthdays, and other family functions since 2010. We opened Hotel Krinoscco two years ago, and despite the challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the widening of the thoroughfares, business is picking up momentum. We’ve nearly 100% occupancy for the 60-room property, which is only 4km from the temple.” The fledgling hotelier is not a man in a hurry.“It may take 10 years to break even. However, I’d like to play the waiting game,”he said. Paying heed to Yogi Adityanath’s call to make UP a $1 trillion economy by 2027, the House of Abhinandan Lodha, a Mumbai-based realty firm, is betting big on Ayodhya. It enjoys a first-mover advantage and has pledged an investment of Rs 12 billion ($144.18 million) in the temple town alone. The company has begun to acquire 100 acres of land that is within 10km from the temple premises. It aims to develop plots varying between 120 square meters and 500 square meters, pending the civic authority’s approval. It plans to sell branded land to its customers, especially a section of NRIs, to build their own houses. Mahant Sri Vivek Acharya, a 13th-generation chief priest of Dant Dhawan Kund, which owns the highest land parcel in Ayodhya, said several leading Indian hotel chains have been in touch.“However, I’m yet to commit to any single hospitality chain,”he said.“All hotels within the radius of Ayodhya Dham will serve vegetarian food in line with our beliefs.”"

The lake outburst also resulted in the breach of the  Chungthang  dam, which is the largest hydropower project in the state. This dam is part of the 1,200-megawatt (MW)  Teesta Stage III Hydro Electric Project , in which the state government is the majority stakeholder.  Satellite images released by the Hyderabad-based National Remote Sensing Centre showed that the area of south Lhonak lake reduced by over 100 hectares compared to its size on September 17. This suggests that the lake outburst caused a flash flood in the Teesta River basin in north Sikkim.  Officials said at least eight people died and 69 more, including 22 army personnel, were missing.   Scientists are exploring whether the earthquake that hit Nepal might be a cause of the flash floods in Sikkim. The lake was already vulnerable and covered an area of 168 hectares. Its area has now reduced to 60 hectares, indicating that about 100 hectares of water volume has breached the level, explained a senior official at the Central Water Commission (CWC) to PTI.  The official stated that while it's difficult to determine right now, a cloud burst does not cause such results. Some experts who have visited the site believe that the earthquake may have triggered the floods there.  The flood alerts were also shared with Bangladesh.  The NRSC satellite imagery revealed that the lake covered approximately 162.7 hectares. Its area increased to 167.4 hectares on September 28 but drastically reduced to 60.3 hectares.   In this satellite data, it is evident that the lake area has significantly reduced compared to the September 17, 2023, RISAT 1A MRS satellite data, read an NRSC report.   The glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in portions of Lhonak Lake, Mangan district, which caused a rapid rise in water levels with very high velocities downstream along the Teesta River Basin in the early hours of October 4, has resulted in severe damage in Mangan, Gangtok, Pakyong, and Namchi districts, the State Disaster Management Authority said.   The Chungthang NHPC dam and the bridge were washed away. Two bridges at Minshithang, one bridge at Zema, and  Ritchu Bridge , including the Sangkhalang bridge, were washed away, the state government said in a statement.  The SDMA's statement highlighted that following the lake outburst, the water level in the rivers rose at a speed of 15 meters per second.  The lake outburst caused extensive damage to life and property, including the breakdown of road networks and communication. Several vital bridges connecting to the forward border areas with Sikkim have been washed away due to the flash floods in Mangan, Gangtok, Pakyong, and Namchi districts of Sikkim, according to Sikkim's Chief Secretary  Vijay Bhushan Pathak .  Arun B Shrestha , senior climate change specialist, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), said: ""We're facing a devastating flash flood in the Teesta River. Information is fragmented, but it appears heavy rainfall from a Bay of Bengal low-pressure depression triggered the disaster. This seems like another unfortunate example of cascading hazards.""  He said that the institute recorded exceedingly high precipitation, exceeding 100 mm within the last 24 hours in the vicinity .  Miriam Jackson , senior cryosphere specialist, ICIMOD, said: ""Intense rain has led to this catastrophic situation in Sikkim where the rain has triggered a glacial lake outburst flood and damaged a dam and caused loss of life and caused further damage to roads and infrastructure. We observe that such extreme events increase in frequency as the climate continues to warm and takes us into unknown territory.""  Sikkim has 733 glacial lakes, with 288 located above an altitude of 5,000 m, according to NRSC.   According to the South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People, south Lhonak lake is a glacial-moraine-dammed lake, located in Sikkim's far northwestern region. It is one of the fastest expanding lakes in the Sikkim Himalaya region, and one of the 14 potentially dangerous lakes susceptible to GLOF.  The lake is located at 5,200 m (17,100 ft) above sea level. It formed due to the melting of the Lhonak glacier. The lake is rapidly growing in size in an abnormally rapid manner due to the melting of the lake's associated South Lhonak glacier and additional melt water from the adjacent North Lhonak and main Lhonak glaciers.  A study published in the journal Science Direct in 2021 stated that since these lakes are mainly situated in remote and unsettled mountain valleys, GLOFs could claim lives and damage assets tens of kilometers downstream.  GLOFs occur when lakes formed by melting glaciers suddenly burst open. This can happen due to various reasons, such as too much water accumulating in the lake or triggers like earthquakes.  When the lake bursts, it releases a massive amount of water all at once, causing flash floods downstream. These floods can be very destructive and dangerous to people and the environment in the area.  Infrastructure exposed to GLOFs in the Teesta valley suggests that many settlements and assets along the river channel at Chungthang are potentially exposed to future GLOFs. This indicates the need for a comprehensive environmental impact assessment and potential GLOF risk mitigation measures.  Some of the largest GLOF events have occurred in the Himalayas, such as the 2013 Chorabari lake outburst, known as the Kedarnath disaster in Uttarakhand. The swelling of the Jhelum river led to Kashmir floods in 2014, and Parechu river flash floods occurred in Himachal Pradesh in 2005.  The Kedarnath disaster, caused by a multi-day cloudburst between June 16-17, 2013, became India's worst natural disaster since the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. The combination of melting from the Chorabari glacier and the eruption of the  Mandakini  river blocked the rivers, causing major overflow. More than 5,700 people were presumed dead.  Destruction of bridges and roads trapped around 300,000 pilgrims and tourists in the valleys leading to three of the four Hindu Chota  Char Dham  pilgrimage sites.   A flash flood in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district on 7 February 2021 ravaged through the valleys of the Rishi Ganga, Dhauliganga and Alaknanda rivers, swept away the unfinished Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Project and inflicted substantial damage on the Rishi Ganga Hydropower Project.  A study published in the journal Nature earlier this year stated that 15 million people worldwide are exposed to potential GLOF impacts.  Populations in High Mountains Asia (HMA) are the most exposed, living closest to glacial lakes, with one million people living within 10 km of a glacial lake. More than half of the globally exposed population is found in just four countries: India, Pakistan, Peru, and China.

The program is initially launching in New Zealand and the Philippines for new users who sign up via the website. The $1 annual fee is intended to “bolster our already significant efforts to reduce spam, manipulation of our platform, and bot activity,” according to anannouncementfrom X. Requiring new users to pay even a small fee creates an increased barrier for bot creators attempting to establish networks of fake accounts quickly. New web users in the two countries must provide a phone number to verify their account and pay the $1 subscription. Without it, they can only view content in a “read-only” mode. The program does not yet apply to new users signing up via mobile apps, though X’s terms and conditions indicate it may expand there soon. The focus on new web-based users makes sense, given that quickly automating account creation through websites is easier than mobile apps. Focusing on two small countries first allows X to test out the system before expanding globally. The new $1 anti-bot subscription is separate from X’s existing $8 per month subscription offering, known as Twitter Blue. The $8 subscription provides users with enhanced features like edit tweets, 1080p video uploads, and reader mode. Only a tiny fraction of users are estimated to pay for Twitter Blue. However, even that small revenue stream is likely welcome for X as it seeks to increase monetization while cutting costs under its new ownerElon Musk. The reasons for launching the program specifically in New Zealand and the Philippines are unclear. However, focusing on regions that have seen more bot activity could help X determine if the fee successfully reduces spam accounts originating from those areas. The relatively small size of these countries also provides a contained environment for X to evaluate the system and iron out any issues before expanding to larger markets. If successful, the $1 anti-bot fee could eventually reach Twitter users in many other countries. Featured Image Credit: iStockphoto; Thank you!"

Pr… [+4962 chars]",Nepal,"Israel pounded Hamas targets in Gaza Tuesday and said the bodies of 1,500 Islamist militants were found in southern towns recaptured by the army in gruelling battles near the Palestinian enclave. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israel's military campaign following Saturday's surprise mass onslaught was only the start of a sustained war to destroy Hamas and ""change the Middle East"". Fears of a regional conflagration have surged amid expectations of an Israeli ground incursion into the crowded Palestinian Gaza Strip from where Hamas launched its land, air and sea attack on the Jewish Sabbath. The death toll in Israel has surged above 900 from the worst attack in the country's 75-year history, while Gaza officials have reported 687 people killed so far. Netanyahu compared the large-scale slaughter of Israeli civilians to the atrocities committed by the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, when they controlled vast swathes of Syria and Iraq. ""Hamas terrorists bound, burned and executed children,"" a seething Netanyahu said in a televised address to the grieving nation late Monday. ""They are savages. Hamas is ISIS."" The veteran leader at the helm of Israel's hard-right coalition also called for an ""emergency government of national unity"" after years of political crisis and bitter societal divisions. The Israeli army has called up 300,000 reservists for its ""Swords of Iron"" campaign and massed tanks and other heavy armour both near Gaza, and on the northern border with Lebanon. ""Around 1,500 bodies of Hamas (fighters) have been found in Israel around the Gaza Strip,"" said army spokesman Richard Hecht. Key ally the United States -- which reported 11 of its own citizens killed, and more missing in the spiralling conflict -- stressed its full support for Israel, as did Britain, France, Germany and Italy. The five Western powers and many other nations have reported citizens killed, abducted or missing, also including Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Nepal, Panama, Paraguay, Russia, Thailand and Ukraine. Hamas has held around 150 hostages since its ground incursion, among them children, elderly and young people who were captured at a music festival where some 270 died. On Monday, Hamas warned it would start killing hostages every time Israel launches a strike on a civilian target in Gaza without warning. Fireballs repeatedly lit up Gaza City before dawn on Tuesday as explosions shook the ground and sirens wailed. Israel imposed a total siege on long-blockaded Gaza on Monday, cutting off the water supply, food, electricity and other essential supplies. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply distressed"" by the siege announcement and warned Gaza's already dire humanitarian situation will now ""only deteriorate exponentially"". The UN human rights chief Volker Turk said Tuesday that imposing ""sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law"". Israeli strikes have levelled residential tower blocks and mosques and wrought widespread destruction in Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, where on Monday many charred bodies were pulled from the rubble. Three Palestinian journalists were killed early Tuesday in an Israeli air strike that hit a Gaza City residential building, a media union and an Hamas official said. The small country, which has long prided itself on a high-tech military and intelligence edge, has been shaken to the core after being blindsided by the massive attack. Washington has pledged to send munitions and military equipment to back Israel and deployed an aircraft carrier group to the eastern Mediterranean. The White House said there was no intention to put US boots on the ground, while also condemning the ""ISIS-level savagery"" of the Hamas attack. Israel faced the threat of a multi-front war after two days of clashes on the northern border with Lebanon with militants from the Iran-backed Hezbollah movements. Unrest has also surged in the occupied West Bank, where 15 Palestinians have died since Saturday. Iran -- which is openly committed to Israel's destruction -- has praised the surprise attack by Hamas but repeatedly denied playing any role in it. Hamas has called on ""resistance fighters"" in the West Bank and in Arab and Islamic nations to join what it has dubbed ""Operation Al-Aqsa Flood"". A senior US defence official said ""we are deeply concerned about Hezbollah making the wrong decision and choosing to open a second front to this conflict"". Global powers and regional governments including Egypt, Turkey and Gulf states, have engaged in frantic diplomacy seeking to prevent any further escalation. Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas that the kingdom was working to ensure the conflict does not spread across the region, state media said Tuesday. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Israel against ""indiscriminately"" attacking civilians and also delivered measured criticism of Hamas, urging both sides to respect the ""ethics"" of war."

Not only does the plan offer the “largest reply boost,” but it also removes ads from your For You and Following feeds, according to a page detailing the features of the subscription . Premium Plus builds on the perks that come with X’s standard Premium plan (formerly Twitter Blue), which includes a blue checkmark, the ability to edit tweets, longer posts, longer video uploads, encrypted direct messages, and more. In addition to Premium Plus, X also introduced a new “Basic” option for $3 per month. However, this plan doesn’t let you pay your way to verification — it doesn’t include a checkmark — and subscribers will only receive a “small boost” to their replies. It also doesn’t include reduced ads or access to X’s media studio. Both new plans are currently available to purchase only on the web. The standard Premium subscription costs $8 per month if purchased directly. Earlier this month, a report from Bloomberg emerged that X had been testing new paid membership tiers . Since taking over last year , owner Elon Musk has begun searching for ways to monetize the platform and even started making users in New Zealand and the Phillippines pay $1 per year to access X.

As part of the trial, ""new, unverified accounts""  would have to pay a $1 annual subscription fee ""to be able to post & interact with other posts."" Existing users would not be affected by the trial, the platform said. The platform added that the new policy wasn't ""a profit driver"" and was instead meant to minimize the influence of bots. Musk and his company have long pondered making changes to the platform's payment plans. Last month, Musk told Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, during alivestreamthat X mightroll out a paywall for all its users. ""We are actually going to come up with a lower-tier pricing. We want it to be just a small amount of money,"" the billionaire said then. ""It's a longer discussion, but this is actually the only defense against armies of bots.""

For those in the test, the new Meta Verified toggle will appear as an option under “Following” and “Favorites” when you tap the Instagram logo at the top of the app. The prominence of the toggle could make paying for Meta Verified, which costs $11.99 on the web or $14.99 in an app, a more attractive proposition as it gives people a new way to try and appear more prominently in an Instagram feed. However, people who are legacy verified badge holders — who haven’t paid for a verified badge — will show up in the verified feed, too, according to spokesperson Matt Tye. Mosseri’s post didn’t say how big the test is or who might have access to it, though he did encourage people to “let us know if you’d be interested in using this.” Tye characterized the test as a “small” one available to “select Instagram users.” Earlier this year, Meta introduced its Meta Verified program for Instagram and Facebook, which gives subscribers things like a blue verification checkmark, better customer support, and protection from impersonation. The company started testing it in Australia and New Zealand first , brought it to the US a month later , and announced in September that Meta Verified would be available for business accounts . Meta announced the program a few months after X, formerly Twitter, introduced paid verification with disastrous results . As part of X Premium, subscribers appear higher up in conversations and search, which has generally made scrolling through replies on X much worse.

<li>Slow-slip events or silent earthquakes take place over weeks or months… [+4270 chars]",New Zealand,"Since 2002,dozensof slow-motion earthquakes have rippled beneath New Zealand. Researchers think a reservoir holding enough water to fill a sea may be the cause. ""Instead of anearthquakehappening over the course of a couple seconds or minutes, these earthquakes can take up to a month to occur,"" Andrew Gase, a marine geophysicist, told Insider. Researchers have simulated slow earthquakes in laboratories. The experiments showed that lots of fluid under high pressure can cause slower earthquakes. The water may help dampen the earthquake, making the shaking less intense. But that was all theoretical until Gase and his colleagues drilled to gather rock samples and took seismic images of aNew Zealand fault, the Hikurangi subduction zone. That's how they discovered a hidden reservoir of water. The finding was published in the peer-reviewed journalScience Advancesin August. ""Finding this much water in the fault kind of makes us think that this could be one of the reasons why New Zealand is so well known for hosting these slow earthquakes,"" Gase said. About125 million years ago, a gigantic volcanic eruption created a mass of igneous rocks known as a volcanic province. It was about a third the size of the contiguous US and eventually broke apart. One chunk, the Hikurangi Plateau, started sinking below New Zealand. Itnow liesabout 2 miles below sea level and is being pushed into the Hikurangi subduction zone. When the researchers drilled into the plateau, they found volcanic rocks. But they weren't like the hard basalt found on land volcanoes. They seemed to hold a lot of water like clay. ""That was unusual,"" Gase said. ""They're extremely soft."" The clay-likevolcanic rocksmeant there was a lot of water in the plateau. It could be a real-world example of the simulated slow-slip events where fluids under pressure caused slower earthquakes. ""This is something that we've hypothesized from lab experiments, and is predicted by some computer simulations, but there are very few clear field experiments to test this at the scale of a tectonic plate,"" the study's co-author Demian Saffer saidin a statement. Part of the Hikurangi subduction zone runs along the eastern coast of New Zealand's North Island. It's where two tectonic plates meet, and the Pacific plate is sinking under the Australian. ""It's kind of like a conveyor belt that's pushing this rock underneath New Zealand,"" Gase said. Usually, the two plates are locked together. When they detach, it can cause a slow-slip event, releasing a large amount of energy over several weeks, theNew Zealand Heraldreported. These slow slips can be the equivalent of a magnitude 6 or 7 earthquake. ""It would be a really big earthquake, but it's just moving really slowly for about a month,"" Gase said. Some can last years. For regular earthquakes, scientists measure the magnitude with a seismometer. ""They shake the ground,"" Gase said. ""They send out seismic waves."" Slow-slip or silent earthquakes often don't produce a signal a seismometer can measure. Instead, researchersrely onGPS to track movement. ""You wouldn't be able to perceive it unless you had a really high precision instrument,"" Gase said. GPS allows them to see the ground move, even if it's just a couple of centimeters. While these quiet quakes happen in many parts of the world without incident, researchers want to know if they could be a kind of early warning for bigger events. Slow slips have occurred before some devastating earthquakes, like theone in Japanin 2011. ""Even though it doesn't seem like a very dangerous phenomenon, it's really important for us to understand so that we can anticipate other types of earthquakes that could be more damaging,"" Gase said."

X, formerly known as Twitter, will start charging users in the Philippines and New Zealand a $1 fee to use the service, a move owner Elon Musk says is aimed at curbing the presence of bots on the site. The companyannouncedthe program, called Not a Bot, late Tuesday, saying the annual fee will apply to new users who want to post, like, reply and quote other content on the platform. Reading posts on the site's timeline will be possible without a charge. Musk hinted at a paywall in the works for users of X in a September interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, claiming that it may be the only way ""to combat vast armies of bots."" The idea is that by charging ""a few dollars or something"" it could deter the creation of new fake accounts since bots just cost ""a fraction of a penny"" to create, Musk told Netanyahu. If the annual fees for using the site are applied more widely, it would mark a major departure for the social media service, which has been free to use since it was founded in 2006. It is unclear why the company chose to start annual fees in the Philippines and New Zealand. Whether and when the initiative will reach other users around the world is also not known. The $1-a-year fee plan wasfirst reportedbyFortune. Cracking down on bots, also known as spam or fake accounts, that mimic real people, has been a focus of Musk since he purchased the platform last year. But despite his best efforts, bots do still remain a persistent problem. Since Musk's takeover, he has made other drastic changes, including reducing staff by more than 75% and making ""verified"" blue check marks available for $8 a month. While Musk says the $1 annual subscription experiment is not aimed at making money, the company has been struggling financially in the face of changes made under the billionaire that have created new levels of chaos and mayhem on the site. Musk himselfhas saidthat advertising revenue on the platform is down 60% since his takeover. Fewer people are using X, too. Newfiguresfrom web traffic tracking firm SimilarWeb show that global web traffic to the site is down 14% compared to last year. In the U.S., which makes up about a quarter of its web traffic, the platform experienced a nearly 20% decline in traffic compared to year-ago figures. Still, new X CEO Linda Yaccarino, a former ad executive,said recentlythat the company could be profitable by early next year, as she works to bring back skittish advertisers who left the platform since Musk assumed the reins. The Israel-Gaza war has tested X in new ways. Since the violence erupted, a flood of bogus claims, unsubstantiated rumors and other falsehoods have inundated the platform. Critics of X point to changes in the site's incentive structure as one reason for the surge in disinformation. For instance, users who pay for a Twitter Blue subscription, affixing a ""verification"" badge to their profile, can make money off posts that go viral, spurring many to take advantage of misleading posts in order to earn a profit. X's handling of disinformation and illegal content on the site since the war started has led to an investigation by the European Commission. Under a European Union law known as the Digital Services Act, social platforms must quickly remove illegal content such as hate speech, incitements of violence, and harmful disinformation. Failing to do could trigger fees equivalent to 6% of a company's annual global revenue."

AUCKLAND, New Zealand — Conservative former businessman Christopher Luxon will be New Zealand's next prime minister after winning a decisive election victory Saturday. People voted for change after six years of a liberal government led for most of that time byJacinda Ardern. The exact makeup of Luxon's government is still to be determined as ballots continued to be counted. Luxon arrived to rapturous applause at an event in Auckland. He was joined on stage by his wife, Amanda, and their children, William and Olivia. He said he was humbled by the victory and couldn't wait to get stuck in to his new job. He thanked people from across the country. ""You have reached for hope and you have voted for change,"" he said. Supporters chanted his campaign slogan which promised to get the country ""back on track."" Outgoing Prime Minister Chris Hipkins, who spent just nine months in the top job after taking over from Ardern in January, told supporters late Saturday he had called Luxon to concede. Hipkins said it wasn't the result he wanted. ""But I want you to be proud of what we achieved over the last six years,"" he told supporters at an event in Wellington. Ardern unexpectedly stepped down as prime minister in January, saying she no longer had ""enough in the tank"" to do the job justice. She won the last election in a landslide, but her popularity waned as people got tired of COVID-19 restrictions and inflation threatened the economy. Her departure left Hipkins, 45, to take over as leader. He had previously served as education minister and led the response to the coronavirus pandemic. With most of the vote counted, Luxon's National Party had about 40% of the vote. Under New Zealand's proportional voting system, Luxon, 53, is expected to form an alliance with the libertarian ACT Party. Meanwhile, the Labour Party that Hipkins leads was getting only a little over 25% of the vote — about half the proportion it got in the last election under Ardern. And in a result that would be particularly stinging for Labour should it lose the seat, National was in a tight race for Ardern's old electorate seat, Mount Albert. The seat has long been a Labour stronghold and was also held by another former Labour prime minister, Helen Clark. The National Party candidate for the seat, Melissa Lee, told The Associated Press she was feeling excited but also nervous about the final result in Mount Albert. ""It's been Labour since 1946. It has been the biggest, safest Labour seat forever,"" she said. ""It would be fantastic if we won it."" Lee said that when she was door-knocking, people had told her they were tired of the current government and were concerned with the state of the economy and the spiraling cost of living. David Farrar, a longtime conservative pollster, said there was still a good chance that Labour would end up holding the seat once all the votes were counted. However, he said, his initial impression of voting throughout the country was that it was turning out to be a ""bloodbath"" for the left. Luxon has promised tax cuts for middle-income earners and a crackdown on crime. Hipkins had promised free dental care for people younger than 30 and the removal of sales taxes on fruit and vegetables. Also at stake in the election is the government's relationship with Indigenous Māori. Luxon has promised to axe the Māori Health Authority, which he says creates two separate health systems. Hipkins says he's proud of such co-governance efforts and has accused Luxon of condoning racism. Within days of taking the reins in January, Hipkins found himself dealing with a crisis after deadly floods and then a cyclone hit New Zealand. He quickly jettisoned some of Ardern's more contentious policies and promised a ""back to basics"" approach focused on tackling the spiraling cost of living. Warm spring weather in the largest city, Auckland, seemed to encourage voters, with queues forming outside some polling places. Early voting before Election Day was lower than in recent elections. During a six-week election campaign, both Hipkins and Luxon traveled the country and hammed it up for the cameras. Earlier in the week, Luxon, who served as chief executive of both Unilever Canada and Air New Zealand, told an energized crowd in Wellington that he would crack down on gangs. ""I've gotta tell you, crime is out of control in this country,"" Luxon said. ""And we are going to restore law and order, and we are going to restore personal responsibility."" Luxon also got cheers when he promised to fix the capital's gridlocked traffic with a new tunnel project. Luxon is relatively new to politics but held his own against the more experienced Hipkins during televised debates, according to political observers. But Luxon also made some gaffes, such as when he was asked in a 1News debate how much he spent each week on food. His answer of ""about sixty bucks"" (U.S. $36) was ridiculed on social media as showing he was out of touch with the cost of living."

At the same time, Musk continues his vendetta against news publishers by stripping The New York Times’ official account of its gold verification checkmark, as first spotted by the Washington Post reported Thursday. “Two new tiers of X Premium subscriptions launching soon,” Musk tweeted early this morning. The lower-priced tier will have the same amount of ads but will allow users unfettered access to the platform while the more expensive option will feature no ads, the X owner says.  The news comes fresh off the heels of news that X began testing a $1 subscription this week for new accounts in New Zealand and the Philippines. Musk claims the subscription tiers are an attempt to combat bots and spam on the app, but it’s also undoubtedly another stream of income for the platform, which has been hemorrhaging both users and advertisers since Musk took over last fall.  As for Musk and the New York Times, a spokesperson for the newspaper confirmed to Gizmodo via phone call that the outlet’s gold checkmark was removed on Tuesday. The spokesperson says the Times received no explanation from X on why the badge was removed—other media outlets such as Vox, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg have retained their gold checkmarks. In its place, a blue checkmark appeared on the Times’ X profile on Friday. X did not immediately return Gizmodo’s request for comment on the decision or the subscription tiers. Musk has apparently had a beef with the New York Times, as the platform originally pulled the outlet’s blue checkmark in April after it refused to pay the exorbitant price for verification, as reported by Bloomberg. X also shadowbanned the Times in August when it was revealed that links to the outlet were throttled ever-so-slightly compared to other news websites. More broadly, however, Musk has been on a crusade against news outlets as a whole—X recently decapitated headlines on the platform, trusting users to manually enter accurate information into tweets themselves."

X's support team made it clear that this ""Not A Bot"" initiative isn't about making money, but rather about weeding out fake accounts.

This new subscription method comes in addition to X's existing subscription plans, including the $8 monthly X Premium (formerly Twitter Blue) and the $1000 monthly Verified Organization plan. Although this new subscription model is only being tested in two countries for now, it's bound to stir up rumors that X might eventually charge everyone.

Now, previously classified official files paint a vivid portrait of her life as a World War Two spy behind enemy lines. In the summer of 1944, in a village in German-occupied western France, a slim young woman with dark hair and grey-green eyes sat in a building with a wireless set, tapping out messages in Morse code. She was an agent in the Special Operations Executive (SOE), known as Churchill's Secret Army. Her codename was Genevieve and she was sending urgent messages back to London. The French resistance in the area was sabotaging key transport links, disrupting German forces as they fought the Allied advance. For this they needed supplies - dropped by air from Britain - and aerial support.  The messages being sent by Genevieve were vital intelligence from inside enemy territory, as they included precise locations for the RAF to bomb, as well as where to drop equipment.  As she typed out her transmission, two German soldiers opened the door, looking for food. Calmly, she closed up the wireless set, pretending it was a case she was packing. Genevieve told them she had scarlet fever - which had been sweeping the area - and said she had to get out of the village. The soldiers left quickly. This was one of several close shaves for Genevieve. Working behind German lines, as the fighting grew closer, was incredibly dangerous, but she never lost her nerve. She had ""tons of guts"" according to her citation for the MBE at the end of the war. Genevieve's real name was Phyllis Latour. After she married, she became known as Pippa Doyle, moved to New Zealand, and rarely spoke about her wartime career.  Now she has died at the age of 102, and for the first time her full wartime story can be told. Latour's wartime SOE file has been released by the National Archives and shows exactly what she did, painting a vivid portrait of one of the little-known heroines of the war. Born in South Africa in 1921 to a French father and British mother, Phyllis was orphaned at the age of four and went to live with an uncle in Jadotville in the Belgian Congo. She spent all her spare time on ""saffaris [sic]"" with her guardian, according to her SOE form, travelling around the country as her uncle tried to stop the smuggling of ivory. It was an exciting time - when she was training for SOE one report noted that she was ""always talking about the Belgian Congo"". Phyllis spoke English, French, some Arabic, Swahili and Kikuyu. At 16 she was sent to boarding school in Kenya, then in May 1939 she left with her guardians for Europe. In November 1941 she joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, or WAAF, as a balloon operator. But it is clear from her files that she yearned for more adventure, and by autumn 1943 she was training for SOE. She was a ""simple-minded, naïve, ingenuous girl"", according to her first report. She was ""bright, eager and plucky"", with a dislike of ""sedentary"" duties - office-based work, in other words. She was ""childlike"" and had ""no grasp of the realities of life"". Male trainers at SOE often underestimated the female agents, according to Clare Mulley, who has written several books about women agents in World War Two. ""Latour's training reports appear dismissive, warning that she is 'unsuitable' for work in the field, but in France she gave exceptional service,"" says Ms Mulley. According to the historian, this was not uncommon. Ms Mulley recalls another trainee's report, which read: ""Would make an excellent wife for an unimaginative man."" A former agent turned trainer, Odette Wilen, dismissed Phyllis Latour on New Year's Day, 1944, as a ""cheerfull [sic] little scatterbrain"" who was ""uncontrolled and stubborn"". She was ""too unreliable emotionally for this type of work"". But Phyllis's reports improved. She was good with a pistol, although a 9mm was too heavy for her. She was sent to SOE's Special Training School in January 1944 and took to parachute jumping with great enthusiasm - though on her first attempt she landed on top of another student. She was allocated to the network of agents - or circuit - codenamed ""Scientist"". Her keyword for communicating with HQ was SMOKEGETSINYOUREYES . The circuit was run by Claude de Baissac, who the head of F (France) section described as ""the most difficult of my officers"". It ran operations across a large swathe of Normandy. Phyllis arrived in France on 1 May, 1944. At first she travelled around the area of Caen and Vire with another agent, who would be covering the area. The Gestapo heard of their presence - and they even encountered a German vehicle full of Allied parachutes which they had found.  Phyllis and her colleague got away, but then had to pack up their base in a village called Champgeneteux in the middle of the night, destroying documents and decamping to St Mars, a resistance base near Nantes. One citation in the file notes how she had to move constantly, without a change of shoes or clothes. ""This did not worry her,"" the file said, ""so great was her eagerness to serve"". In one of the rare interviews she gave in later life, Phyllis described how she hid her codes, on fine silk, by wrapping them round a knitting needle, then feeding that into a shoelace, which she used to secure her hair. She didn't carry the bulky wireless sets around - she had 17 of them, in different places. She carried out 135 transmissions in the few weeks she was in France. As the Americans began to advance rapidly, life became even more difficult behind the German lines. The SOE agents used to stay on farms, but once the RAF bombing increased, the Germans occupied these. Phyllis started sending her transmissions from the open fields instead. At the beginning of August, as the US forces had taken over, Phyllis contacted them, but was initially taken prisoner, until they confirmed her identity. Back in Britain, Phyllis looked for other work as an agent in the field, trying to avoid being sent back to WAAF and a ""disciplined"" existence, which ""horrified"" her.  On 7 December 1944 one senior officer wrote he had seen her, saying: ""Latour seemed to think that SOE was displaying gross ingratitude towards her and others like her. She told me that no attempt had been made to find her other employment."" She asked to go to the Far East, but was told there was no employment there for women as agents. Then, she was recommended to MI5, but they had no ""suitable employment"" either. So she volunteered to go to Germany for SOE and another round of intensive training followed, this time with glowing reports, especially from parachute training.  ""She is extremely keen on her job and will put her whole heart and soul into the work,"" the instructor wrote. Phyllis was, he said, the first woman who enjoyed the experience and asked to have an extra turn. The instructors turned her down as they ""didn't want to set a precedent"". But the Allied armies' rapid advance meant Phyllis was never sent on this second mission. She stayed in England, a change in fortune which appeared not to suit her.  In June 1945 one note says: ""Since the collapse of Germany, Miss Latour has suffered from severe nervous strain."" She had seen the resident psychiatrist at the Air Ministry, who recommended she be released ""immediately"" from her home military department, the WAAF. They wanted Phyllis to return ""home"" to South Africa as soon as possible. In September 1945, Phyllis was awarded an MBE. The recommendation says she was ""a bit scatters"" - a scatterbrain, in other words. ""Always wanted to be doing something dangerous but had no idea it was dangerous. Thought it was all rather fun. Tons of guts. Wants to go on with the work, provided it's dangerous enough."" Vera Atkins, who was in charge of female SOE agents in France, wrote to Phyllis that she was ""delighted"" by the MBE.  She asked whether Phyllis had ""settled down again to shooting elephants and ostriches and other peace-time occupations"". ""After the thrill of clandestine resistance in enemy-occupied territory, many former SOE agents found it hard to adjust to what one called 'the horrors of peace',"" says historian Clare Mulley, adding that returning SOE agents were given no support or counselling to help them adjust.  There was little opportunity to make use of their exceptional field skills. After World War Two, Phyllis married and lived in Kenya, Fiji and Australia, before settling in New Zealand. France had already awarded Phyllis the Croix de Guerre, but in 2014 she was made a Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur, the country's highest decoration, in a special ceremony in New Zealand. Of the 39 women agents who served with Special Operations Executive in the field in France, Phyllis Latour - Pippa Doyle - was the last survivor."

After all, ""free speech"" isn't very free if you're asked to cough up a regular fee. But the billionaire seems to havea grand plan for X,which involves taking the ""free"" out of ""free speech."" It couldn't have come at a more difficult moment. This week, Musk's social-media companystarted to test a new $1 annual subscription featurecalled ""Not A Bot"" for new users creating an account in New Zealand and the Philippines. It's part of an effort to reduce spam and manipulation, the company said. This week also happens to have been one of the worst for X's reputation since Musk's takeover of the company formerly known as Twitter, as the raging Israel-Gaza conflict hastriggered the spread of alarming amounts of disinformation, lies, and inaccuracies. Musk has flirted with the idea of putting the entirety ofX behind a paywallfor some time. His rationale for doing so has typically revolved around the idea that a paywall could go a long way towards removing the spam bots that clog up the platform with falsehoods. There may be some merit to that. A paywall, for instance, may have stoppeda fake account posing as an Al Jazeera journalistfrom cropping up and spreading unfounded claims about the Israel-Gaza conflict. But by starting to charge users for access to X, Musk enters dangerous territory: a platform vital for documenting and sharing current affairs through free speech in real-time risks turning into a pay-to-play game. If it isn't clear why that's bad, take a moment to reflect on the severity — and sources — of theinformation war that has gripped Musk's platformsince the onset of Hamas' terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7. Blame does not fall solely on bots for the spread of disinformation, faked images, and malicious misrepresentation of events about the Israel-Gaza conflict. Users exercising their version of free speech have been found culpable, too. A post that recently circulated on X included a video described asfootage of Hamas firing rockets from the Gaza Strip towards Israel.Reuters reported,however, that matching footage circulated in 2020with Syria tagged as the location.The news agency added that the video did not depict the October 2023 conflict between Israel and Hamas. Countering falsity has required free, unfettered access to X for users likeShayan Sardarizadeh, a journalist who specializes in tackling disinformation. Highly active users tagging posts with a corrective Community Note also require the same access. That unfettered access has clearly offered a vital means of exercising free speech that counters speech aimed at sowing discord, spreading outrage, and adding chaos to a situation already drowning in it. Putting a fee on that access could do a lot of harm if it meansunverified claims go unchecked. It's worth emphasizing that X is experimenting witha subscription fee that is just $1. There is no certainty on whether or not X will extend this policy to other regions. But Musk's free-speech absolutism will come under question if a monetary fee stops voices of reason from engaging on his platform."

People voted for change after six years of a liberal government led for most of that time by Jacinda Ardern. The exact makeup of Luxon’s government is still to be determined as ballots continued to be counted. Luxon arrived to rapturous applause at an event in Auckland. He was joined on stage by his wife, Amanda, and their children, William and Olivia. He said he was humbled by the victory and couldn't wait to start his new job. He thanked people from across the country. “You have reached for hope and you have voted for change,” he said. Supporters chanted his campaign slogan, which promised to get the country “back on track.” Outgoing Prime Minister Chris Hipkins, who spent just nine months in the top job after taking over from Ardern in January, told supporters late Saturday he had called Luxon to concede. Hipkins said it wasn’t the result he wanted. “But I want you to be proud of what we achieved over the last six years,” he told supporters at an event in Wellington. Ardern unexpectedly stepped down as prime minister in January, saying she no longer had “enough in the tank” to do the job justice. She won the last election in a landslide, but her popularity waned as people got tired of COVID-19 restrictions and inflation threatened the economy. Her departure left Hipkins, 45, to take over as leader. He had previously served as education minister and led the response to thecoronaviruspandemic. With all the regular votes counted, Luxon's National Party had 39% of the vote. Under New Zealand’s proportional voting system, Luxon, 53, plans to form an alliance with the libertarian ACT Party. Meanwhile, the Labour Party that Hipkins leads got just 27% of the vote — a little over half the proportion it got in the last election under Ardern. There are still thousands of special votes to be tallied, which account for about 20% of the total. Among the incumbent politicians to lose their seats was Nanaia Mahuta, the foreign minister. And National and Labour remained in a tight race that was too close to call for Ardern’s old electorate seat, Mount Albert. The seat has long been a Labour stronghold and was also held by another former Labour prime minister, Helen Clark. The National Party candidate for the seat, Melissa Lee, told The Associated Press she was feeling excited but also nervous about the final result in Mount Albert. “It’s been Labour since 1946. It has been the biggest, safest Labour seat forever,” she said. “It would be fantastic if we won it.” Lee said that when she was door-knocking, people had told her they were tired of the current government and were concerned with the state of the economy and the spiraling cost of living. David Farrar, a longtime conservative pollster, said there was a good chance that Labour would end up holding the seat once all the votes were counted. However, he said, his initial impression of voting throughout the country was that it was turning out to be a “bloodbath” for the left. Luxon has promised tax cuts for middle-income earners and a crackdown on crime. Hipkins had promised free dental care for people younger than 30 and the removal of salestaxeson fruit and vegetables. Also at stake in the election was the government’s relationship with Indigenous Māori. Luxon has promised to axe the Māori Health Authority, which he says creates two separate health systems. Hipkins says he’s proud of such co-governance efforts and has accused Luxon of condoning racism. Within days of taking the reins in January, Hipkins found himself dealing with a crisis after deadly floods and then a cyclone hit New Zealand. He quickly jettisoned some of Ardern’s more contentious policies and promised a “back to basics” approach focused on tackling the spiraling cost of living. Warm spring weather in the largest city, Auckland, seemed to encourage voters, with queues forming outside some polling places. Early voting before Election Day was lower than in recent elections. During a six-week election campaign, both Hipkins and Luxon traveled the country and hammed it up for the cameras. Earlier in the week, Luxon, who served as chief executive of both Unilever Canada and Air New Zealand, told an energized crowd in Wellington that he would crack down on gangs. “I’ve gotta tell you, crime is out of control in this country,” Luxon said. “And we are going to restore law and order, and we are going to restore personal responsibility.” Luxon also got cheers when he promised to fix the capital’s gridlocked traffic with a new tunnel project. Luxon is relatively new to politics but held his own against the more experienced Hipkins during televised debates, according to political observers. But Luxon also made some gaffes, such as when he was asked in a 1News debate how much he spent each week on food. His answer of “about sixty bucks” ($36) was ridiculed on social media as showing he was out of touch with the cost of living. ___ Follow AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific"

The move aims to boost revenue amid reports of declining ad sales since Musk’s takeover. In an Oct. 20tweet, Musk confirmed that Twitter will offer two new premium subscription levels beyond its existing $8 per month Twitter Blue service. One lower-priced option will retain ads while providing other perks. A more expensive ad-free tier will remove all advertisements. Musk did not reveal pricing details. This aligns withfindingsfrom app researcher Aaronp613, who uncovered code referring to three subscription levels dubbed Twitter Blue, Twitter Blue Plus, and Twitter Gold. It also echoes a Bloombergreportof Twitter testing multiple paid tiers. Musk’s confirmation comes as other social networks explore ad-free options. Meta is reportedly considering an ad-free tier for Facebook and Instagram in response to an EU ruling. TikTok also just launched a pilot ad-free subscription. The move aims to diversify revenue as Twitter struggles to woo back advertisers. According toReuters, ad income has plummeted since Musk took over. New sales chief Linda Yaccarino is working to attract advertisers by sharing metrics like 245 million daily active users and 500 million daily posts. Still, many brands paused spending over content moderation concerns. Musk’s mass layoffs also impacted the sales team. Twitter is experimenting with subscription offerings beyond the upcoming tiers. Last week, itrolled outa $1 per year tier in the Philippines and New Zealand focused on identity verification. According to Twitter, reducing bots and spam accounts took priority over revenue. However testing cheap access could expand its reach in emerging markets to eventually convert users to paid subscribers. Featured Image Credit: Photo by Brett Jordan; Pexels; Thank you!"

The X owner confirmedreportsthat the social media site is planning to overhaul its X Premium subscription, adding a cheaper tier and a more expensive ad-free version as it seeks to bring in more paying subscribers. ""Two new tiers of X Premium subscriptions launching soon,"" said Muskin a post on X. ""One is lower cost with all features, but no reduction in ads, and the other is more expensive, but has no ads,"" Musk wrote. Bloombergreported earlier this monththat X was testing a triple-tiered premium model, with cheaper versions of the current $7.99 subscription. X Premium, formerly Twitter Blue, wasone of Musk's first major overhaulsfollowing his takeover of Twitter last year, allowing users to buy a verified checkmark for $8 a month. The initial launch backfired spectacularly when the site was quickly overrun with impersonations of major celebrities and brands, includinga fake Eli Lilly accountthat sent the pharmaceutical company's stock price plunging when it tweeted: ""Insulin is free now."" The subscription service has since been overhauled and expanded, with subscribers getting an edit button and fewer ads. However, the number of people paying for itremains small, with researchers estimating only 900,000 of X's245 milliondaily active users are subscribed, suggesting that it is unlikely to make up forthe company's lost advertising revenue. The latest changes to the service come as X starts charging new users in thePhilippinesand New Zealandan annual fee of $1to use the platform through its ""Not a Bot"" trial program. The company has said that the fee is not a profit driver but is instead meant to make it unaffordable for bots to operate on the platform. Musk has often floated the idea of charging users, and suggested in a livestream last month that hecould put X behind a paywall, calling it ""the only defense against an army of bots."" Social media's free-with-ads model has been the key driver of its enormous success, but amid a global advertising recession and changes toApple's app-tracking rules which make it harder for these platforms to target ads to customers, many are now looking at alternative solutions. Meta is reportedly consideringcharging users in Europe $14 a monthto access ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram, as it grapples with new EU rules that would allow users to opt out of personalized ad-tracking. TikTok, meanwhile, is testing a $4.99-a-monthad-free subscription tier. X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider, made outside normal working hours."

""One of the things that concerns me most right now, is to understand quite what the shape of the UK impact will be,"" Ken McCallum said in an interview. He also warned there was a risk that events in the Middle East could radicalise people towards violence. He was speaking at an unprecedented public appearance of security chiefs of the Five Eyes alliance in California. The heads of US, UK, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand security agencies were appearing together for the first time to warn of technological innovation being stolen by China.  In an interview with the BBC, Mr McCallum said ""the scale and monstrous nature"" of the Hamas attack on Israel had come as a ""shock"".  Discussing the possibility of the Israel-Gaza conflict radicalising people in the UK towards violence, he said: ""That is certainly a risk."" ""It has always been the case that lots of would-be-terrorists in the UK draw inspiration through their distorted understanding of what is happening in other countries.""  He said he could not comment on specific intelligence relating to any threats the Security Service is currently seeing.  But he said that MI5 was already watching a ""pretty large cohort"" of people with extremist mindsets and that one of the most challenging parts of its work was trying to detect when these people, often acting alone, suddenly moved towards violence in new or unpredictable ways.  In recent years, MI5 has seen a shift toward lone-actors inspired by events but not formally part of any organisation or group. They can be harder to spot and to work out when they are about to act, Mr McCallum said. US officials say they have already seen a rise in reported threats in the wake of events in the Middle East.  ""We cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or other foreign terrorist organisations could exploit the conflict to call on their supporters to conduct attacks on our own soil,"" FBI Director Chris Wray, told reporters.  ""We are also particularly alert to the potential these events have to inspire violence against Jewish Americans or Muslim Americans, institutions and houses of worship.""  A six-year-old Muslim boy was stabbed to death in Illinois on Saturday in what has been described as a hate crime. Stanford University in California was chosen as the venue for this unprecedented first public meeting of the Five Eyes because it lies in the heart of Silicon Valley and the security chiefs are issuing a public warning about China stealing innovation.  But in private meetings together, the Middle East will be high on the agenda.  ""As you'd expect, we will also use our time together to discuss a range of other issues in private, including what Hamas's attack means both in the region and in our homelands,"" Mr McCallum said. The MI5 head told the BBC that one of the most difficult aspects of the role was to balance resources against different types of threats which were equally concerning.  ""How do you balance the ability to track a teenage would-be terrorist consuming extreme right-wing and hateful material in his bedroom and potentially considering buying a bladed weapon with the longer term risks posed by fast or precious cutting edge research from one of our universities? They both matter to our national security."""

The social media giant is testing the feature, which will show posts exclusively from users who have paid for Meta's Verified subscription, among a limited number of users, as Meta continues to explore ways to get more users to pay for its platforms. ""We're exploring this as a new control for people and a way for businesses and creators to get discovered,"" said Instagram boss Adam Mosseri, in comments on his Instagram broadcast channelreported by the Verge. The ability to post in the new verified channel will be available for all users who pay for Meta's verified badge. The paid subscription, which wasannounced by Mark Zuckerberg in February, costs $12 on the web and $15 on the Instagram app. At the time, Zuckerberg wrote that Instagram verified would increase ""authenticity and security"" by requiring paying users to confirm their identity in exchange for features such as increased visibility and ""direct access"" to customer support. The subscription service, which saw Meta break with its longstanding practice of not charging users for its social media products, was initially trialed in Australia and New Zealand before being rolled out in the US a month later. Meta is also reportedly considering plans tocharge users in Europefor access to ad-free versions of Instagram and Facebook, as it grapples with new EU rules on personalized advertising. Social media companies are increasingly moving away from the traditional model of free-but-with-ads that has allowed platforms such as Instagram and Facebook to become global behemoths. X, formerly known as Twitter, introduced paid verification a few months before Meta, and has continued to experiment with directly charging usersdespite its disastrous launch. X owner Elon Musk recently announced that it would begincharging users a $1 annual feein order to cut down on the number of bots using the site.

The Elon Musk-owned platform announced the new program in aposton Tuesday, saying that new unverified users in New Zealand and the Philippines will be required to pay $1 a year, adding that existing accounts are not affected. New users who choose not to subscribe will only be able to take read-only actions, such as reading posts, watching videos, and following accounts. The move follows increasing speculation that the platform would soonlaunch some kind of subscription tierfor those currently using X for free. “Starting today, we’re testing a new program (Not A Bot) in New Zealand and the Philippines,” X said in its message on Tuesday. “New, unverified accounts will be required to sign up for a $1 annual subscription to be able to post & interact with other posts. Within this test, existing users are not affected.” The company said the test has been introduced “to bolster our already successful efforts to reduce spam, manipulation of our platform and bot activity, while balancing platform accessibility with the small fee amount,” adding: “It is not a profit driver.” So far, it said, subscription options have turned out to be the most effective way to tackle bots and spam on the platform. Musk, who acquired X — then Twitter — last year for $44 billion,said last monththat X was “moving to having a small monthly payment,” claiming it was the only way to effectively deal with the “vast armies of bots” plaguing the platform. Content from the more malicious bots can fill up DM inboxes and replies with spam, hateful content, or material aimed at swaying elections. Musk believes that charging a fee will work against bot operators, making it more expensive to set up fake accounts and, with a new payment method necessary for each one, more troublesome, too. Before now, X only had one subscription option, called Premium. Costing from $84 a year, Premium offers users various features such as an edit button, prioritized rankings in conversations and search, longer posts, text formatting, and fewer ads. Tuesday’s move suggests that the $1 annual subscription could be rolled out globally before too long. We’ll have to wait to see if the fee extends to non-verified accounts that already exist, or if it will only have to be paid by those opening new accounts."

As spotted by Gizmodo, X (formerly Twitter) is rolling out ""video and audio calling"" for Premium users on the platform. Since this is an early variant of the feature, there isn't much to really dive into. What we do know is turning on the feature within your direct message settings will let users select who can call them. A newly created support page for the feature states, ""All accounts are able to receive calls."" However, this is a Premium-based feature, and it's been stated that only those users can actually call someone on top of receiving calls from other subscription holders. Calls are also open by default to those you follow and those saved in your address book if you've previously given the app access to that information. The page adds that for someone to call you, they must have sent you a DM at least once. Early version of video & audio calling on 𝕏 https://t.co/aFI3VujLMhOctober 25, 2023 With the feature being accessible by heading into the app's Settings > Privacy & Safety > Direct Messages > Enable Audio & Video Calling, Musk adds it's ""still a beta product, but it is promising."" Lastly, the feature has arrived for iOS users ahead of Android. The support page's mention of the latter suggests it'll arrive ""soon."" X CEO Elon Musk teased his vision for bringing video and voice calling to the platform back in November 2022. This idea was wrapped in his plans to make X's direct messaging much more private and secure for users interested in taking part. Musk had initiated discussions with Signal's creator and former CEO Moxie Marlinspike about bringing a strong level of encryption for user's DMs. Meanwhile, other dealings within X's atmosphere involve its latest experimental choice of charging new users $1 per month to combat bots. This has spurred whispers that if the platform observes positivity with its test in the Philippines and New Zealand, it could spread to more regions in a more concrete form. Despite X standing against the idea that this new method is simply another way to make money, it could likely arrive as another reason for people to continue abandoning the platform altogether."

Tickets are reselling on secondhand marketplaces for sky-high prices, while supporters are complaining that the process to buy seats for marquee games has been poorly managed. India are set to face Pakistan in the western city of Ahmedabad on Saturday. The match-up is one of cricket's fiercest rivalries but only takes place during World Cups, because India's governing body severed ties with Pakistan's after the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. On the resale siteeticketing.co, the cheapest seats sell for over 50,000rupees($600), while the most expensive are available for as much as 240,000 rupees, or nearly $3,000. Meanwhile, former derivatives trader Nikhil Wadhwani toldBloombergthis week that he'd snapped up a ticket to the game for just $30 back in August – and then sold it on X for over $250, netting a 780% gain. ""I was absolutely shocked to see the demand,"" Wadhwani said in an interview with the outlet. Some fans have complained that the buying process has been chaotic, creating opportunities for scalpers. Having said the India-Pakistan clash was sold-out, the tournament's organizers put another 14,000 tickets on sale at around $20 Sunday – under 1% of what some fans have paid for seats on secondhand sites. Theofficial websitefor the World Cup says tickets for future India matches are ""coming soon"" – even though the Rohit Sharma-led side are slated to take on New Zealand in Dharamsala in just 10 days' time. The ticketing fiasco is just the latest example of a trend that's emerged since the pandemic: even though the world economy is slowing down and some developed countries are flirting with a recession, people are willing to pay through the nose to see live events. Taylor Swift fansspent thousands of dollarsto see the ""Anti-Hero"" singer's Eras Tour, even if it meantflying to a different continentwhere tickets were more readily available. Seats to see Beyoncé and Olivia Rodrigo have been changing hands for similar prices. The cost of seeing the NBA and both professional and college football live has alsoedged up steadilyin recent years, while tickets for a series of cricket matches betweenarch-rivals England and Australiaearlier this summer cost around 190 pounds ($230) firsthand."

According to an Oct. 18 Reutersreport, aftermeetingswith Silicon Valley companies, FBI Director Christopher Wray said China was engaged in the “most sustained, scaled and sophisticated theft of intellectual property and expertise in human history.” The officials warned that China is aggressively using cyber intrusions, spying, corporate investments and more to steal secrets from businesses and research institutions across multiple sectors — including quantum technology, robotics, biotechnology and artificial intelligence. “Every strand of that web had become more brazen, and more dangerous,” Wray said. He accused China of having a bigger hacking program than all other major nations combined — which, together with traditional espionage and theft of trade secrets, gave it enormous power. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation’s director-general, Mike Burgess, revealed his agency had recently busted a Chinese plot that involved planting an academic at a prestigious Australian research institution to steal secrets. “This sort of thing is happening every day in Australia, as it is in the countries here,” he said. Burgess said while China’s intention to innovate for its own interests was “fine,” its methods went far beyond traditional espionage. He warned China was stealing more corporate and personal data than any other nation “by orders of magnitude.” The officials called out China’s use of artificial intelligence to amplify its capabilities and make its already mammoth hacking programs even more effective. “If you think about what AI can do to help leverage that data to take what’s already the largest hacking program in the world by a country mile, and make it that much more effective — that’s what we’re worried about,” Wray said. In response, Chinese government spokesperson Liu Pengyu denied the allegations and said China was committed to intellectual property protection."

The exact makeupof Luxon’s government is still to be determined as ballots continue to be counted, but his victory marks a big change after six years of a liberal government mostly led by Ardern, who resigned after saying she no longer had “enough in the tank” to do the job. “On the numbers tonight National will be in the position to lead the next government,” Luxon, a former executive who once ran Air New Zealand and entered politics just three years ago, told supporters in Auckland after he arrived to rapturous applause. “We will make this an even better country,” he said, doubling down on his promise to get the country “back on track”. Ardern and the liberals had won the last election in a landslide, but her popularity had taken a hit after longstanding COVID-19 restrictions and an historically high inflation rate affected voter perceptions. Hipkins, her 45-year-old replacement, had previously served as education minister and led the response to the coronavirus pandemic. In Saturday’s election, the Labour Party led by Hipkins won only a little over 25 percent of the vote, which was about half the votes it received in the last election under Ardern. Labour is also seeing itself threatened as it may lose Ardern’s old electorate seat in Mount Albert, which has been a liberal stronghold for many decades. Nanaia Mahuta, the foreign minister, also lost her constituency seat and will not be returning to the parliament. Luxon has promised to cut taxes for middle-income earners, tackle the inflation issue, remove sales taxes on fruit and vegetables, and crack down on crime. Luxon may yet need support from the populist New Zealand First Party as well as the ACT party because its majority remains slim. The final vote count will be revealed after overseas and special votes are counted in early November.          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

They include the ability to tweet, retweet, like posts and reply to posts.  Those who opt out of the subscription fee will only be able to read posts, watch videos and follow accounts.  The social media platform said that the aim is to ""reduce spam, manipulation of our platform and bot activity"". New accounts will also be required to verify their phone number, though Mr Musk has said that it will still be free to create ""read only"" accounts, which do not have key features. . Last month, the boss of X, Tesla and SpaceX suggested that all X users may have to pay for access. Since Mr Musk bought Twitter for $44bn last year, it has seen a continuous revenue decline. While there is a clear financial interest for the company to charge users, the controversial billionaire has said that getting people to pay for the service is aimed at tackling bots. He has previously said that a bot costs ""a fraction of a penny"" to make. ""But if somebody even has to pay a few dollars or something, some minor amount, the effective cost to bots is very high"". Paid subscribers of an enhanced service, called X Premium, now pay for more features like longer posts and increased visibility on the platform. X Premium currently costs $8 a month in the US. The price differs depending on which country a subscriber resides in, while other users can still use X for free. One risk of putting X behind a paywall is that the platform may lose a large chunk of its users. That in turn, could drive down advertising revenue, which currently accounts for the vast majority of the company's income. In recent weeks, the company has been investigated by the European Union for the possible spread of terrorist and violent content and hate speech, after Hamas's attack on Israel. It has also been fined by Australia's internet safety watchdog for failing to cooperate with a probe into anti-child abuse practices."

Here’s what you need to know about the main candidates and the key issues: Voting will start on Saturday at 9am local time (Friday at 20:00 GMT) and close at 7pm (06:00 GMT). However, early voting began on October 2 and more than a million people have already cast their ballots. General elections are held every three years in New Zealand using a mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting system. New Zealanders will cast two votes at the ballot box, one for their local district representative and one for their party of choice. The MMP system makes it hard for one party to win a majority of the seats because it gives seats in the House of Representatives to parties based on total votes, often leading to no single party getting more than half of them. However, the election in 2020 proved to be an exception when Jacinda Ardern led her Labour Party in alandslide victory. Usually, the party with the most votes needs to form a coalition or agreement with another party or other parties to form a government. Polls have indicated the current ruling Labour Party is unlikely to hit the threshold of 61 seats needed to govern, even if its coalition partner the Green Party wins its 15 predicted seats. Chris Hipkins, Labour Party– Prime Minister Hipkins’s Labour Party is seeking another term in office, but polls suggest the centre-right opposition National Party is likely to win the most seats and could return to government with the help of coalition partners. Hipkins, 45, is the current Prime Minister of New Zealand aftertaking up the postearlier this year when his predecessor Ardern stepped down in January. The Labour leader was formerly a minister of health and education during the pandemic. His party has campaigned to fund cost-easing measures and make food more affordable. Having promised not to form a coalition with his party’s closest rival, the National Party, Hipkins remains optimistic Labour will win, telling reporters: “I look forward to being back here in three years time as Prime Minister seeking another term.” Christopher Luxon, National Party –Luxon, 52, comes from a business background. He served as chief executive of the national carrier, Air New Zealand, and was with Unilever before that. Entering politics in 2020, he is a relative newcomer, but polls indicate that his centre-right party is likely to win the lion’s share of the votes. The National Party has campaigned to reduce the cost of living, provide tax relief, and improve healthcare and education. If it wins, the party will likely have to form a coalition government and will need at least oneminor partyto join up with. The party has said its preferred partner is ACT party, but that it is also prepared to discuss partnering with New Zealand First. “There has been a bit of conflict between ACT and New Zealand First but the polls are indicating New Zealand First has upward momentum ahead of election day,” Dr Lara Greaves, Associate Professor in political science at Victoria University of Wellington, told Al Jazeera. “There is still an outside chance of polling error, but barring the polls being mistaken or some kind of sudden lurch to the left, it seems like National will win.” David Seymour, ACT New Zealand Party– The country’s third largest political party, ACT has been campaigning for welfare and government spending cuts, but it has also been talking about reducing the rights of Indigenous Maori people, who make up just over 16 percent of the country’s population of five million. Winston Peters, New Zealand First Party– At 78, Peters has been in politics for more than four decades. He created New Zealand First to campaign for lower rates of immigration, and he remains a vocal critic on the topic. These elections could see his party play a crucial role in forming the next coalition government. According to Greaves, the cost of living crisis has been dominating this election. The country has been facing a budget deficit since 2019, and inflation is at a three-decade high. Rents too are reported to be at record highs and house prices have become unaffordable. “New Zealand is facing similar inflation issues to other nations, but these pressures compound ourpre-existing housing crisis,” Greaves said. “The parties have been debating potential visions for alleviating cost-of-living pressures.” Law and order is the other hot issue voters are considering. “The right-wing parties are consistently trying to paint the left as soft on crime. It hasn’t been the main issue but is certainly one that has been widely discussed this campaign, especially around sentencing for crime and youth offenders,” Greaves said. In the run-up to elections, right-wing parties have faced accusations of stoking racial division, with the  ACT party vowing to limit the use ofMaori languagein everyday life and also to dismantle the Maori Health Authority, a measure set up to counter systemic disadvantage. “Yes to some degree there have been issues around race and the role of Maori in the governance of the country,” Greaves said. “The Maori tend to rate these issues as more important than the general electorate does, but many Maori leaders and commentators have expressed disappointment around Maori issues being a ‘political football.'” Official results will be announced on November 3, although preliminary results would start coming at 7pm (06:00 GMT) on election night. The electoral commission aims to release 50 percent of the results by 10pm (09:00 GMT) and 95 percent by 11:30pm (10:30 GMT).          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Three-time champions New Zealand inflicted more World Cup heartbreak on Ireland, beating them 28-24 to bring a bitterly disappointing end to Irish captain Johnny Sexton’s stellar career. The All Blacks put in a brilliant defensive performance to prevail 28-24 over Ireland in a titanic match on Saturday, setting up a meeting with Argentina for a place in the final and destroying Irish dreams of a first world title. The defeat ended Ireland’s run of 17 successive Test victories and denied Andy Farrell’s team the chance of a first-ever semifinal. The All Blacks played for 20 minutes with 14 men against the Six Nations champions and had to dig deep to defend their try line through 40 phases in the dying seconds as the top-ranked Irish searched for a winning try. It was an eighth quarterfinal loss for the Irish, ended their winning streak at 17 matches and sent flyhalf Sexton into retirement without the glittering prize with which he had hoped to crown his career. “You’ve got to work hard for fairytale endings and we didn’t get it but that’s life,” 38-year-old Sexton said. “We left no stone unturned, we ticked every box, trained the house down, and played pretty well tonight. But fair play to the All Blacks.” While quite different from Ireland’s epic win over South Africa in the pool phase, it was equally engrossing with both teams hitting hard in defence and wanting to use the ball in hand when they got it. Ireland’s variations in attack caused New Zealand problems all night but the All Blacks were ruthless when they got a sniff of the line to pull away on the scoreboard every time Andy Farrell’s team got close. “I am so proud of the way we played. Our defence, particularly in that last part, was brilliant,” said New Zealand coach Ian Foster, who almost lost his job after a home series loss to Ireland last year. “It was a real arm wrestle. They’re a proud team, Ireland, they really hung in there. I thought we had them a couple of times but they kept making the game really tight.” Fainga’anuku, Ardie Savea and Will Jordan scored the tries that sent the three-time champions into the semifinals for the ninth time and avenged last year’s series loss. “That was one hell of a game and somebody had to lose – unfortunately it was us tonight,” said Ireland coach Farrell. “I was so proud of the way we came back and kept attacking them right until the death. We’ve had a good run but sport can be cruel sometimes – I guess that’s why we love it.” The All Blacks come back to Stade de France to meet Argentina next Friday after the Pumas rallied to beat Wales 29-17 in Marseille earlier.

The National party’s Christopher Luxon is leading Labour’s Chris Hipkins in the race to become New Zealand’s next prime minister, but any victory could depend on the support of smaller right-wing and populist parties. Less than a year after Jacinda Ardern, the darling of the international community,passed the leadershipto Hipkins, New Zealand’s left-leaning Labour party is facing an election where many of its trademark policies – from green farming to Maori co-governance – could be rolled back if the centre-right Nationals take power on October 14 as the opinion polls suggest. Four years since the devastatingChristchurch Mosque attacks, which were carried out by an Australian white supremacist, there are also concerns about the tone of the campaigning. “I think some of our politicians are certainly playing the race card in this election,” Hipkins said during a debate last month between the leaders of the two main parties. Hipkins questioned Luxon’s willingness to work with the New Zealand First party, quoting a racist statement made by one of the party’s candidates. The centre-right Nationals are leading in the polls but may need one or both of New Zealand First and the AMP party, another populist right wing party, to be able to form a government. Responding to Hipkins’s reference to racist campaigning, Luxon told Hipkins he was willing to “make the call” to work with New Zealand First if it meant “stopping you, Te Pati Maori and the Greens coming to power”. Labour’s current government is a coalition with the Green party, while Te Pati Maori is a smaller party representing New Zealand’s Indigenous Maori population who make up about 17 percent of the nation’s five million people. Racist campaigning during the election has not been limited to speeches made to loyal followers. It has also spilt over into action, fuelling concern among the country’s Muslim and Maori leaders. Hana Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, Te Pati Maori’s youngest candidate, has experienced a “string of attacks”, including an intruder inside her home, according to the party. We are excited to announce Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke as our candidate for Hauraki-Waikato. Hana is an activist, published author and expert on the maramataka and taiao, and at 20 years old represents a new generation of Māori political leadership.pic.twitter.com/4eDOa9Yp7N — Te Pāti Māori (@Maori_Party)June 28, 2023  Te Pati Maori President John Tamihere said it was “clear” that the attacks against Maipi-Clarke were “politically motivated as the perpetrator is a well-known advocate and campaigner for the National Party”, a claim the National Party has denied. The situation prompted 30 Maori leaders to write anopen lettertwo weeks before the election stating: “Racism, in any form, should have no place in our elections.” Christchurch Mosque shooting recommendations shelved Aliya Danzeisen, the national coordinator of the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand told Al Jazeera that recent attacks during the election “underscore” whyrecommendationsfrom New Zealand’s Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Christchurch Mosque attacks “should have been implemented three years ago”. Earlier this year, Hipkins shelved new hate speech laws – one of the commission’s recommendations – claiming cost of living pressures were more urgent. Danzeisen said there has been a “significant lack of commitment” to implement recommendations that could protect “vulnerable communities from targeting and dehumanising speech” and that she says would make New Zealand “a safer nation”. Fifty-one people were killed when a lone gunman attacked Muslim worshippers at the mosque in the largest city in New Zealand’s South Island in March 2019. In its 800-page report, the commission found intelligence services had been distracted from investigating right-wing threats because of a focus on the “threat of Islamist extremist” activity. Agriculture, New Zealand’s biggest industry, is another key issue in Saturday’s elections. Some farmers are concerned about the costs of implementing the world’s first “fart tax“, even as their farms are at risk from intensifying climate disasters. There are an estimated six million cows and 26 million sheep in the country. In February, after Cyclone Gabrielle left many New Zealand farms underwater, with mudslides, flattened trees and animals in need of rescue, New Zealand’s government quickly announced tens of millions of dollars in emergency grants. But in the lead-up to the election, some farmers have been vocal about the potential costs of Labour’s tax on methane emissions from livestock, which is set to be introduced in 2025. Nicola Harvey, author of FARM: the making of a climate activist, told Al Jazeera that the Labour and National parties had been “pumping the brakes on agriculture regulations in order to get votes”. Harvey’s cattle farm was among those hit by storms earlier this year – after she had published her book looking at the role farmers can play in addressing the climate crisis. Another “contentious debate” is the potential lifting of New Zealand’s long-standing ban on genetically modified crops, she said. Harvey says some parties have changed their position on the ban because genetically modified crops could help build resilience to climate change, but she questions whether this makes sense as it concentrates “yet more power with the big agriculture companies”. While Ardern is travelling the world, and has a new position as a senior fellow at Harvard University in the United States, back in New Zealand her successor has struggled to maintain the comfortable lead that Ardern – whose popularity stretched well beyond New Zealand’s borders – enjoyed. Compounding his problems, hefell sick with COVID-19just two weeks before the election and had to take campaigning online. While Ardern remains a popular presence at international meetings, back at home different parties have different views on how, and if, New Zealand should engage with the world, as well as with China and the United States. One reason why Labour may not again get to form the government is because New Zealand First’s Winston Peters has ruled out working with the party again and may instead help the Nationals. Peters previously served as foreign minister under a coalition government with Labour from 2005 to 2008 and again from 2017 to 2020. As foreign minister, he introduced the Pacific Reset policy in 2018, to improve New Zealand’s relations with its neighbouring countries at a time when China had begun increasing its presence in the region. If Peters returns to the position of foreign minister he would potentially replaceLabour’s Nanaia Mahuta, a daughter of Maori royalty. By contrast the ACT, another potential coalition partner for the Nationals, wants to shut down New Zealand’s ministry for the advancement of Pacific People. ACT is also more outspoken on geopolitical issues than many New Zealand parties. Its leader David Seymour attended a pro-Hong Kong democracy protest in Auckland in 2019 – and the party wants to increase New Zealand’s historically low defence spending to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from less than 1 percent. In recent years New Zealand – or Aotearoa as it is known in Maori language – has been making progress in reviving Maori culture and recognising Maori co-governance, more than 180 years after the British Crown and Maori leaders signed theTreaty of Waitangi. But both ACT and New Zealand First have run on platforms that push back against some of the perceived gains made by Maori people, even as the Indigenous population continues to experience systemic inequality. “I call on Maori women to respond at this time in our history by attending at the polling booths in numbers never seen before,” Annette Sykes, a Rotorua activist and lawyer who has been active in efforts to revive Maori culture and self-governance, told Al Jazeera. Voting is not compulsory in New Zealand, although more than 80 percent of enrolled voters voted in the last election in 2020 when Ardern won in a landslide. Sykes said this year’s poll was an opportunity to “examine and to redefine the terms upon which we will live and work and care for our homelands as our ancestors did”. By “voting in record numbers” said Sykes, Maori women could “reaffirm our power confirmed in the founding documents of the modern Aotearoa-New Zealand nation state”.

If the opening match of the 2023 edition is anywhere near as thrilling as the2019 final, the tournament will be off to a grand start in the cauldroncontroversially namedafter India’s current prime minister. In terms of the squads, not much has changed from 2019 as both have retained most of their core group of players. However, England’s blue-eyed boy of limited-overs cricket and World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan has been replaced by his then-deputy Jos Buttler. Meanwhile, New Zealand’s captaincy has temporarily been overtaken by Tom Latham as Kane Williamson recovers from an ongoing knee injury. New Zealand will hope to win the title that has eluded them in the previous two finals while England will look to stamp their authority on the game as they try to become only the third team after the West Indies and Australia to defend their title successfully. ""Our style is to be aggressive and positive and push the envelope."" 🏏💥💪 Hear exclusively from the skipper ahead of our#CWC23campaign 🌍🏆 — England Cricket (@englandcricket)October 3, 2023  While the Blackcaps will sorely miss their captain and most prolific batter, the team will not be short on confidence, having recently beaten Bangladesh in an ODI series. They will also miss the services of veteran fast bowler Tim Southee, who continues his recovery from thumb surgery. “No Kane and no Tim as well,” stand-in captain Latham said ahead of the opener. Hear from Tim Southee on his delayed arrival to India following surgery on his injured thumb in New Zealand.#CWC23pic.twitter.com/TceOb0PRhj — BLACKCAPS (@BLACKCAPS)October 4, 2023  The big news out of the England camp is that Ben Stokes could sit out due to a hip injury. Buttler said he’d rather not take a risk by playing Stokes if he’s not fully fit, given the length of the tournament. “It’s not the time to take big risks at the start of the tournament. It’s going to be a long tournament,” Buttler said at his pre-match press conference. No ODI match between these two opponents can come close to beating the drama of the 2019 final, but they have met on 95 occasions in the ODI format, and England are ahead on the wins tally by one. England have 45 wins compared with New Zealand’s 44, four matches did not yield a result and two were tied – one being the 2019 final, which was decided by a tiebreaker of boundaries scored. England head into the tournament on the back of two series wins, one of which came against New Zealand.

Portland Bait and Tacklein Victoria, Australia, posted photos of the white shark carcass to their Facebook page on Tuesday, calling it ""equal parts cool and terrifying."" The bait shop manager, Ben Johnstone, told Insider the shark was about 3 meters long, or nearly 10 feet. Johnstone said they believedkiller whaleshad attacked the shark because they had been spotted in the area a couple days prior to the shark carcass appearing on the beach. He also noted that killer whales have been documented attacking white sharks. Killer whales off the coast of South Africa have been documented on several occasions attacking great white sharks specifically to eat their livers. Rare footage captured for Discovery Channel's Shark Week in 2022 showedthree orcas killing a great white shark in order to eat its liver. The video supported a study published last year that suggested killer whale attacks had forced white sharks to flee from waters near South Africa. The study also found some of the whales had removed the shark's hearts as well. Orcas hunting white sharks has also been documented near Australia, Lauren Meyer, a trophic ecologist at Flinders University, told the Australian outletABC News. Meyer said she could not say for sure that the shark carcass had been attacked by a killer whale. But she said that it was likely an orca attacked the shark to ""slurp out"" its liver. ""We see this with things like humpback whales, where [killer whales] come in and actually eat the tongue and leave the rest of the whale,"" Meyer told ABC. ""We certainly see that they prefer the liver of white sharks, mako sharks, bronze whalers and sevengills, and even tiger sharks."" Meyer added there have been at least nine documented interactions between white sharks and orcas near Australia and New Zealand. She added she was not surprised to see the carcass wash up in the area, noting its a corridor for white sharks and that orcas are known to hunt there. Vanessa Pirotta, a wildlife scientist in Australia, also said the shark was likely targeted by an orca for its liver, the Australian outlet9Newsreported. Pirotta said orcas are ""very strategic and clever"" and that scientists are still trying to understand why then can also be such ""picky eaters."" As for thewhite sharks that likely fled waters in South Africa over the orca attacks, they've recently been found — a study published this month indicated the sharks had actually migrated east."

Barely two hours into his firstCricket World Cupmatch, Rachin Ravindra was thrown into the limelight by the New Zealand captain and asked tobowl against the tournament’s defending championsat the world’s biggest cricket stadium. The 23-year-old from Wellington duly obliged and came on to bowl his left-arm spin in the 17th over of England’s innings. Three balls in, attacking England batter Harry Brook smacked away Ravindra’s third, fourth and fifth deliveries for two fours and a six. Off the final delivery, Brook attempted another aerial shot but was caught by Ravindra’s hometown teammate Devon Conway. The youngster had his first wicket in an ICC Cricket World Cup. He failed to take any more wickets and gave away 76 runs in his far-from-economical 10-over spell. The all-rounder would have to wait to showcase his skills with the bat and perhaps repay his India-born parents’ faith in naming him after the great Indian batters Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar. “Back in the day when Mum and Dad were deciding on names, they liked Rahul and Sachin. So they took Ra from one and Chin from the other and named me Rachin,” he revealed in a pre-tournament interview with the World Cup broadcaster. “Two amazing players and I’m very lucky to be named after them.” Named after Rahul & Sachin. After growing up:pic.twitter.com/QRoq7Nv6mm — Lucknow Super Giants (@LucknowIPL)October 5, 2023  Back on the field in Ahmedabad, it didn’t take long for another opportunity to come by for Ravindra. With his cricket-mad parents watching in the stands, Ravindra came on to bat less than 10 minutes into New Zealand’s innings. The tall basketball-loving cricketer found himself batting at the position that is usually taken by New Zealand’s most prolific batter Kane Williamson, who is recovering from a knee injury. Unfazed by the occasion and his failure to score off the first six balls, the curly-haired left-handed batter launched into an attack against England’s fast bowler Chris Woakes in the fifth over. Thereon, Ravindra hit five sixes and 11 fours as he raced to an 82-ball-100 – New Zealand’s fastest World Cup century. He finished his innings unbeaten on 123 and shared an unbroken 273-run partnership with his good friend Conway, who top-scored with 152. A@cricketworldcupdebut to remember!

Four years later, he has an 82-ball century in the opening game of the 2023 World Cup,” wrote cricket writer Matt Roller in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.

However, when a reporter pressed him on his identity and how sees himself, Ravindra was quick to say: “I am very proud of my roots and ethnicity [but] I completely see myself as a Kiwi.” Ravindra is not new to international cricket, having made his debut in September 2021, and had been marked as one for the future by cricket experts before the World Cup. But with the world’s eyes set on the tournament in India, Ravindra couldn’t have chosen a better opportunity to make his mark and that, too, in front of his idol, Tendulkar, who was watching closely from the stands.

X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, has begun charging new users in New Zealand and the Philippines to use the platform’s basic features and aims to expand the annual fee to all new users globally. Under the trial, new users in the Philippines and New Zealand will have to pay about $0.75 and $0.85, respectively, each year, to be able to post and engage on X. Those who decline to pay will only be able to read posts, watch videos and follow accounts, the company said. “This will evaluate a potentially powerful measure to help us combat bots and spammers on X, while balancing platform accessibility with the small fee amount,” the company said in a statement. Bots are accounts run by computer programs rather than humans. The annual subscription is the latest in a string of controversial changes to the platform since billionaire Elon Musk bought Twitter last year for $44 billion. Thousands of employees have been fired, content moderation cut and the blue tick – once used to identify verified accounts – given to anyone willing to pay$8 a year. In July, the company rebranded to X anddropped the blue bird logothat had come to symbolise what the platform was all about. X said the new fee would “bolster” existing efforts to reduce spam and “manipulation of our platform and bot activity”. Existing users in the Philippines and New Zealand are not affected. Earlier this month, the Reuters news agency reported that X CEO Linda Yaccarino told the platform’s lenders that the company planned to test three tiers of its subscription service based on the number of ads shown to the user. Musk floated the idea of anannual subscriptionin September, saying it would help tackle bots, which can be used to artificially amplify political messages or racial hatred.

Replacement fly half Handre Pollard kicked a last-gasp penalty as South Africa somehow found a way to get past a dominant England and claim a 16-15 victory that sent them into a Rugby World Cup final against fellowtriple champions New Zealand. The defending champions looked on the verge of defeat on Saturday as England’s kicking game kept them pegged back in their own half on a rainy Paris night and earned a 15-6 lead in the semifinal, but they hit back with a try by RG Snyman before replacement Pollard landed a penalty from almost on the halfway line to snatch victory. It was a second successive single-point victory for the Springboks after theybeat France 29-28which means the two superpowers of the sport will meet in the final for the second time, after South Africa triumphed on home soil in 1995 in their first appearance at the tournament. “It was really ugly but that is what champions are made of,” said Springboks captain Siya Kolisi. “Credit to England. They were written off before the World Cup but pulled themselves together and showed who they are. They are not a team you take lightly but to my team, we found a way to fight back into the game.” For most of Saturday’s match, it looked as if it would be the 2019 runners-up returning to the final. Coach Steve Borthwick had promised he had a plan to unsettle the world champions but there was nothing radical about their approach as they kicked relentlessly in the rain and outplayed the Springboks in the air. That early control earned Owen Farrell two penalty opportunities, both of which he slotted for a 6-0 lead. Manie Libbok landed one for the Springboks but looked off the pace and was replaced by Pollard after 31 minutes, who soon scored a penalty. England, however, maintained their disciplined approach, gaining ground from their deep kicking, and another Farrell penalty gave them a deserved 12-6 half-time lead. England, widely written off and 5-1 outsiders despite winning five successive games from the easier side of the draw, stretched their lead to 15-6 with a brilliant 47-metre Farrell drop goal and an upset looked likely.      With half an hour to go, all the South African replacements were on as their coaches desperately sought to find a foothold, though England were to pay a heavy price for their failure to turn their dominance into any more points. Since beating South Africa in the pool stage in 2003, England have now lost five successive World Cup games against them and not managed a single try, but even another penalty might have made the difference on Saturday. The Springboks had barely been out of their half before a superb touch-finder by Pollard enabled Snyman to charge over for the only try of the match. Pollard converted to close to within two points 10 minutes from time but it was still England making most of the running until they conceded a scrum penalty with three minutes to go. Pollard, called up to the squad midway through the tournament to replace injured hooker Malcolm Marx, duly slotted it with minimum fuss. It was the first time South Africa had led and they defended England’s final assaults strongly until a knock-on ended the challenge. Pollard was delighted with his winning kick. “It was a big moment but it is what you want as a player on this stage, to have moments like that as a fly half is what you live for,” he said. Borthwick praised his team and said they would build for the future. “We came here believing we would win and the players deserve enormous credit for that,” he said. “We have a very smart group of players that are learning very quickly because we have had to do it very quickly. The opposition have had four years and we have had four months. That is why the players deserve enormous credit.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Some residents of Porirua, New Zealand, have spent the better part of a yearblasting the singer's songswhile driving around town at night to win the title of ""siren king."" In today's big story, we're taking a deeper look at thenumber of partner departures at Goldman Sachsunder CEO David Solomon. What's on deck: But first, how many people have left?  At least 210 Goldman Sachs partners have left on David Solomon's watch. Insider came to that number after an exhaustive search of regulatory filings, media reports, and conversations with sources by Dakin Campbell, Emmalyse Brownstein, Walt Hickey, and Kaja Whitehouse. When broken down by year, that amounts to anaverage annual departure rate of 43.4, per our calculations, slightly above Goldman's projections of 30 to 40 annual partner exits. It's also higher than Insider's analysis of yearly partner exits during the 14 years before Solomon took over as CEO, which came to 40.4. Tracking the departure rate of Goldman's top executives was done to understand the reality — or myth — behind the much-discussed concept of a partner exodus under Solomon. Youcan view all 210 names here, along with an analysis of the years they left and what division they were in. Goldman, for what it's worth, wasn't a fan of our work, suggesting there are a ""number of discrepancies"" in our ""back-of-the-napkin math,"" per bank spokesperson Tony Fratto.  As is always the case with data, there are a few ways to interpret partner departures under Solomon. While partner departures under Solomon have increased, according to our analysis, it hasn't been a massive bump. The average annual departure rate is up less than 7% during his tenure, per our calculations. And when you factor in how bloated the partnership got under former CEO Lloyd Blankfein — hitting 472 at one point — it's fair to say some trimming was due. The highest number of departures also came during Solomon's first year in charge, which seems normal. New leadership typically leads to more churn as the new boss gets their house in order. It's also important to remember Solomon isn't beholden to partners. As valuable as these executives are, it's not pre-1999 anymore when partners funded the business. Goldman's shareholders — not its partners — are the people Solomon has to answer to at the end of the day. With that being said, the partner exits aren't all easily explained. The departure of newly minted execs — at least two who were named partner in 2022 are already gone — seems particularly troubling. Goldman also likes to pitch departing partners as an extension of the firm. Former Goldman partners become future Goldman clients, the bank likes to say. And while that sounds great on paper — and is often the case — it doesn't always work like that. Consider Omer Ismail, whodeparted Goldmanafter being tapped to head its entire consumer business to lead a Walmart-backed fintech and tooksome top executives with him.

The Biden administration has developed a set of separate but overlapping partnerships in Asia, including an intelligence-sharing arrangement with the “Quad” grouping of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia, according to U.S. officials who asked not to be identified discussing matters that aren’t public. The web of relationships also includes trilateral partnerships among the U.S., Japan and South Korea, and one encompassing the U.S., Japan and the Philippines, the officials said. Read More:The U.S. Is Beefing Up Alliances Across Asia—But Don’t Expect an ‘Asian NATO’ Anytime Soon The push also involves strengthened bilateral sharing of information with Japan, India and Vietnam, according to the officials, who added that a major focus of these relationships is boosting resilience to Chinese offensive operations online. These new and strengthened partnerships, known formally as intelligence liaison relationships, are in part aimed at reducing the growing power of China’s spy apparatus, which a recent U.K. parliamentary reportdescribedas the world’s largest. The administration effort is part of a broader drive to deepen links across the region amid growing alarm at the threat from Beijing. “Intelligence liaison can serve as an important force multiplier,” said Daniel Byman, a specialist on the topic at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It can expand overall collection as different countries will have access to different secrets in different parts of the world.” The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on the relationships. A White House spokesperson said U.S. cooperation in the region includes sharing information but declined to comment on specific relationships. Japan has been deepening security cooperation with like-minded countries in Asia and the Indo-Pacific, including on intelligence and information, Cabinet Secretary for Public Affairs Noriyuki Shikata said by email. India’s Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment. The South Korean, Australian, Philippine, and Vietnamese governments did not respond to requests for comment. Read More:China's Ambitions, Russia's Nukes and TikTok: Spy Chiefs Talk Biggest U.S. Security Threats China’s increasing assertiveness in the region, combined with leadership changes in some capitals, has made countries such as South Korea and the Philippines more willing to cooperate of late, the U.S. officials said. Some partners in the region also hope the ties will provide some security in the event Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidential election next year. The closer links are already delivering results, the officials noted. Late last year, India was able to repel a Chinese military incursion in the Himalayas thanks to strengthened intelligence-sharing with the U.S. military,according to U.S. News & World Report. In May 2022, the Quad countriesannounceda pact that provides data from commercial satellites to countries across the Pacific, allowing them to track theactivitiesof China’s maritime militia, as well as smuggling and illegal fishing. Deepened ties with Japan in this area come after what Washington sees as a quiet push by Tokyo to resolve longstanding U.S. concerns about its ability to keep a secret, U.S. officials said. In May, the U.S. Space Forceannouncedthe delivery of sensitive satellite-tracking equipment to Japan. In a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday, Japan’s defense minister Minoru Kihara vowed to carry out a drastic upgrade of information protection and cyber security capabilities with American help, according to a readout from the Japanese Defense Ministry. Still, obstacles remain — not least because of questions about the U.S.’s own ability to keep a secret. In April, the Justice Departmentchargeda 21-year-old National Guard airman, Jack Teixeira, with illegally disseminating classified information, including sensitive battlefield data about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and revelations that the U.S. eavesdropped on allies such as South Korea. The partnerships will complement the “Five Eyes” arrangement that has long been the cornerstone of U.S. intelligence partnerships. That informal network consisting of the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand hasshifted its focusto China in recent years, but its exclusive English-speaking membership limits its reach and relevance in Asia. Five Eyes countries have been sharing secret information for decades through intimate networks of officials that permeate their intelligence, defense and foreign ministries. Asia’s emerging spy pacts are much newer and will likely take time to rival the Five Eyes. “The Five Eyes’ dominance is pretty established, but when you start to work on different problems you get different priorities,” Byman said. “As we shift to China, then countries like Japan and South Korea become more important, alongside Five Eyes partners in the region like Australia and New Zealand.” —With assistance from Sudhi Ranjan Sen and Isabel Reynolds."

In their study reported in the journalNature Communications, Rebecca Newman and Ilan Noy calculated estimates of damage related to climate change by comparing damage wrought by extreme weather events against economic losses over the past 20 years.Economic forecasters are able to make predictions about the costs of climate change by comparing storms and other extreme weather events, such as droughts andheat waves, in the distant past against those that occur today, and then adding up the differences in financial losses.Newman and Noy calculated annual average losses of $140 billion from extreme weather events due to climate change over the period 2000 to 2019, though they note that estimates from year to year varied dramatically depending on the number and type ofextreme weather eventsthat occurred.They also suggest that their estimates are likely low due to a lack of data for manyextreme eventsin low-income countries and note that their estimates do not include incidental costs, such as loss of crop land or a rise in sea levels.The researchers also estimated that the number of people adversely impacted by climate change over the same time period to be approximately 1.2 billion. One notable factor that appears in their estimates is the valuation of human lives lost—$7 million per person. Their figure comes from models that have been created by economists in the U.S. and U.K. to assess average economic loss to an economy when a person dies from non-natural causes. They note that approximately two-thirds offinancial lossesthat occur due to climate change are due to loss of human life.The researchers suggest that their methods for calculating past losses due toclimate changecould be used to make estimates about future losses, which could be used to calculate how much money needs to be collected by agencies building disaster recovery funds to rebuild countries that are not able to pay for their own recovery efforts."

South Africa have continued their march towards the semifinals of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 with a190-run winover fellow contenders New Zealand at Pune’s MCA Stadium. Helped by centuries from Quinton de Kock and Rassie van der Dussen, the Proteas posted 357-4 after being asked to bat first by New Zealand stand-in captain Tom Latham on Wednesday. Keshav Maharaj took four wickets, Marco Jansen took three and Gerald Coetzee took two as South Africa recorded their sixth win of the tournament to dislodge India from the top of the points table on their net run rate. 🇿🇦 PROTEAS DROWN BLACK CAPS An batting masterclass from RVD(133) & QDK (114) to earn South Africa a victory in Pune. This was accompanied by brilliant bowling from Keshav Maharaj &  Marco Jansen 👏 🇿🇦 move to the top of the#CWC23standings 🔝#NZvSA#BePartOfItpic.twitter.com/2cK2Dd9JSf — Proteas Men (@ProteasMenCSA)November 1, 2023  In a highly anticipated contest days after the two nations clashed in the Rugby World Cup final, de Kock struck 114 and van der Dussen exploded late to score 133. “Clinical display I would say,” South Africa captain Temba Bavuma said. “With the bat, we handled the challenge up front and with the ball nipping around. The big partnership really set it up for the boys. “With the ball, we sustained the pressure throughout their innings. … Quite clinical with the execution of our skills.” The Proteas built on the de Kock and van der Dussen 200-run stand with 119 in the last 10 overs as David Miller put the New Zealand bowlers to the sword with a 30-ball 53. “We were speaking about 300 to 320 at one stage in the middle, but we’ve seen so often in the last 12 to 18 months what the guys coming in can do,” player of the match van der Dussen said. “We knew if we could set a platform again for them, I mean the sky’s the limit. We [almost] got to 360, so we were pretty chuffed about that.” Kiwi Tim Southee dismissed van der Dussen on a day of little joy for New Zealand, who had lost the bowling services of seamer Matt Henry due to a right hamstring problem midway through South Africa’s innings. Neesham was struck on the hand while stopping a ball off his own bowling and was able to bat only at number nine although he did not suffer broken bones. “Not our best performance,” Latham said. “We were put under pressure with that massive partnership Rassie and Quinton had up top. “At the halfway mark it was a big score but a decent surface. From a batting point of view, you need partnerships. To be three, four, five down early and with our backs against the wall, we weren’t able to build those partnerships.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

But one New Zealand town says it has had enough of Celine Dion, after car drivers joined a craze of blasting out her ballads at 2am. Residents of Porirua have launched a petition to bring an end to the noise. But participants of the so-called siren battles say they are a way to express themselves. The battles involve groups of people gathering in an area with their cars, blasting music from sirens more typically used for emergency warnings.  The idea is to play music from the sirens the loudest - and the clearest. French-Canadian diva Dion has become the artist of choice not only because of her popular emotional ballads, but because much of her music - including Oscar-winning My Heart Will Go On, from 1997 film Titanic - has high treble, NZ website The SpinOff reports. ""Celine Dion is popular because it's such a clear song - so we try to use music that has high treble, is clear and not much bass,"" Paul Lesoa, one of founders of a group that runs siren battles in Auckland, told the site. The cars can have anywhere between seven to 10 sirens, with competitions usually held throughout the night. They take weeks to prepare for, as participants source sirens online and solder speakers and amplifiers to frames that sit on cars. Mr Lesoa told The SpinOff he felt the stigma around the battles was unfair. ""We just love music, we love dancing, and doing this is better than night clubbing or drinking in a bar in the city, where there's fights etc,"" he said.  He said he had applied to Auckland Council for a permit but was yet to hear back.  ""Basically everyone has a hobby and while our hobby can be quite disturbing and we understand how disturbing it can be, we just want our own proper, safe space away from people to do it."" Wes Gaarkeuken - the author of a petition hoping to stop the siren battles in Porirua, on the North Island - said taxpayers are ""tired of the inaction and dismissive attitude shown by the council and the mayor concerning this issue"". The petition has amassed hundreds of signatures and calls on the Porirua City Council to stop people blasting the music all night.  One man, Stephen Lewis, wrote next to his signature that ""sleep is a basic human right"". Another woman, Diana Paris, conceded that while she enjoyed listening to Dion ""in the comfort of my lounge and at my volume, I do not enjoy hearing fragments of it stopping and starting at any time between 7pm and 2am"". Porirua City Council had previously reached an agreement with those participating in the siren battles, which involved groups going to industrial areas and finishing by 10pm. But the battles have returned to the town. Mayor Anita Baker told Radio New Zealand she was ""sick to death"" of the battles and wanted participants to return to areas where not everyone would have to listen to them. ""We haven't got anywhere in our city where there's not houses that would hear anything."" RNZ recently revealed that police had received up to 40 reports of incidents between early February and early October this year.  Earlier this year, Dion cancelled all the shows she had scheduled for 2023 and 2024, telling fans she was not strong enough to tour after being diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder. "

In the past decade,scholars have begun to documentthe negative impacts of AI on people with low incomes and the working class, particularly in the justice system.Research has shown ethnic minorities are more likely to bemisidentified by facial recognition software.AI's use in predictive policing is also an issue as AI can be fed data fromover-policed neighborhoods, which fails to record crime occurring in other neighborhoods.Thebias is compoundedfurther as AI increasingly directs police patrols and other surveillance onto these already over-policed neighborhoods.This is not just a problem overseas.

New Zealand has opened an inquest into the murder of 51 people by a self-proclaimed white supremacist at two Christchurch mosques in 2019. “I ask simply that we keep each of the51 peoplewhose lives have been lost, and that common goal at the centre of this hearing,” Deputy Chief Coroner Brigitte Windley said as she opened proceedings on Tuesday. Windley said the inquiry, which is scheduled to last six weeks, would “seek to shine a light” on what happened and would consider making recommendations to reduce the chances of a similar event happening again. The March 15, 2019 attacks in the southern city were theworst mass shootingin New Zealand’s history, and shocked the country. The gunman, Australian Brenton Tarrant, is now serving awhole-life sentencein prison after being convicted on 51 charges of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one charge of committing a terrorist act. Family and friends packed the court for the emotionally charged opening session, which included a traditional Maori welcome, a reading from the Quran and a moving video tribute to each of the victims. The inquiry will examine 10 issues including the response by emergency services and hospital staff, whether the gunman had direct assistance from any other person and the cause of death for each of the deceased. Windley is not expected to release her findings until some time in 2024. Observers were shown a harrowing video depicting the gunman’s movements around Christchurch on the day of theattack, including footage he had filmed using a GoPro camera.      Armed with semiautomatic weapons, Tarrant first attacked Friday worshippers at Christchurch’s Al Noor Mosque before driving to the nearby Linwood Islamic Centre, livestreaming the killings. His victims were all Muslim and included children, women and the elderly. Two people died from their injuries in hospital. The inquest will examine the response times of police and emergency services, the medical response at each of the mosques, whether Tarrant was helped in planning the attack, and whether any lives could have been saved. “This pursuit of truth is crucial for healing and closure,” said Maha Galal, spokesperson for the 15 March Whanau Trust representing some of the victims’ relatives. The families of the victims “are united in their pursuit of understanding, seeking clarity on whether their loved ones could have survived”, Galal added. Then-prime minister Jacinda Ardern moved quickly to tighten gun laws in the aftermath of the attacks and put pressure on social media giants to curb online extremism. ARoyal Commission of Inquiryinto the shootings found that intelligence services had been distracted from far-right threats because they were too focused on the “threat of Islamist extremist” activity. But the 800-page report concluded that while mistakes had been made, the attacks could not have been prevented. Following its release, Ardern apologised for the government’s shortcomings, and acknowledged its failings. “Ultimately, this roughly 800-page report can be distilled into one simple premise: Muslim New Zealanders should be safe,” she said. “Anyone who calls New Zealand home, regardless of race, religion, sex or sexual orientation should be safe.”               Follow Al Jazeera English:"

South Africa produced a magnificent defensive display to edge 14-man New Zealand 12-11 in a compelling arm-wrestle of a Rugby World Cup final and win the Webb Ellis Cup for a record fourth time. Only a single yellow card had been shown in nine previous World Cup finals, but the crackdown on foul play in the game led to four being handed out over 80 minutes of intense rugby played out in front of a crowd of 80,065 at the Stade de France on Saturday. All Blacks skipper Sam Cane suffered the ignominy of being the first player to be sent off in a title decider when his card for a high tackle was upgraded to a red after a bunker review just before half-time. Despite playing for three-quarters of the match a man short, however, the All Blacks stuck to their ball-running game plan and scored the match’s only try through Beauden Barrett to get within a point of the lead just before the hour mark. The Springboks, led by man of the match Pieter-Steph du Toit, managed to hold firm under huge pressure over the final quarter and Handre Pollard’s four first-half penalties proved sufficient to add another title to those of 1995, 2007 and 2019. South Africa’s triumph kept the trophy in the southern hemisphere for the fifth straight tournament, and Siya Kolisi became only the second captain after All Black Richie McCaw to lift it twice. “There are no ways I can explain it. The All Blacks took us to the end, they took us to a dark place,” Kolisi said. “Credit to my boys too for the fight. I am just grateful we could pull it off. “There is so much going wrong in our country, and we are like the last line of defence and we can show that we can achieve so much together.” All Blacks flanker Shannon Frizell was the first to be shown a yellow card as early as the third minute for a clearout on Bongi Mbonambi that forced the Springboks hooker off the rain-sodden pitch with a leg injury. Flyhalf Pollard kicked the penalty and added another in the 12th minute as New Zealand waited nervously to hear whether Frizell’s yellow would be upgraded to a red. Frizell did come back on and helped New Zealand win a penalty that Richie Mo’unga slotted over to cut the deficit but Pollard replied with a 46-metre effort to give South Africa a 9-6 lead at the end of the opening quarter. New Zealand were down to 14 men again just before the half-hour mark when Cane clattered head-first into Springboks centre Jesse Kriel, but this time there was no reprieve and the All Blacks skipper sat out the rest of the game. Pollard kicked his fourth penalty after the red card was confirmed and even though Mo’unga replied with another three-pointer before the break, the Springboks went into half-time a man up and with a 12-6 lead.      No team had ever recovered from a half-time deficit to win a World Cup final, and the Springboks came out flying in the second half, looking to drive home their advantage. Kolisi was sent to the sin-bin in the 46th minute for a high tackle on Ardie Savea. However, New Zealand scrum-half Aaron Smith thought he had scored the first try of the match eight minutes later after a brilliant break from Mo’unga. That score was called back for a knock-on earlier in the move, but Beauden Barrett was awarded a try four minutes later despite winger Mark Telea looking to have fumbled the ball forward in the tackle before the fullback touched down. It was the first try South Africa had conceded in four World Cup finals, but Mo’unga missed the conversion from wide-out and the Springboks held on to the lead. Kolisi had, by now, returned to the fray after his card was not upgraded, and South Africa brought their famed “bomb squad” off the bench to relieve fatigued forwards. South Africa winger Cheslin Kolbe was the fourth player to be yellow-carded seven minutes from time, but New Zealand’s Jordie Barrett struck the subsequent 48-metre penalty attempt wide of the posts. New Zealand had also been hoping to win a fourth World Cup, and coach Ian Foster thought the way the cards for Cane and Kolisi played out had been a decisive factor. “The game has got a few issues it’s got to sort out,” he said. “That’s not sour grapes. There were two similar incidents, one was a red, one was a yellow, and that’s the game.” A distraught Cane said he “would have to live forever” with the red card he received. “We have been at the tournament for two months, and anything around the head has ramifications,” Cane told reporters. “I am not here to say whether it is right or wrong, it can’t be changed. Unfortunately, it is something I will have to live with forever.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

The attack follows a surge in anti-Semitic incidents across Europe. Oskar Deutsch, a leader of Vienna’s Jewish community, reported the vandalism and arson in a social media post on Wednesday, saying areas of the city’s central cemetery were severely damaged. “During the night a fire was set on the Jewish part of the central cemetery,”he wrote.“The anteroom of the ceremonial hall [was] burned out. Swastikas were sprayed on exterior walls. No people were injured. The fire department and police are investigating.” In der Nacht wurde am jüdischen Teil des Zentralfriedhofs (IV. Tor) ein Brand gelegt. Der Vorraum der Zeremonienhalle ist ausgebrannt. An Außenmauern wurden Hakenkreuze gesprayt. Personen kamen nicht zu Schaden. Feuerwehr und Polizei ermitteln.pic.twitter.com/LLvCrrXIge Deutsch shared photos of the aftermath, showing firefighters inspecting a heavily charred and smoke-filled ceremony hall. What appear to be crude swastikas were also seen scrawled in fluorescent paint on a wall outside. A spokesperson for the local fire service, Gerald Schimpf, told the Austria Press Agency that the fire seemed to have broken out sometime on Tuesday night, but had mostly died out on its own by the time firefighters arrived the next morning. The Vienna State Police later confirmed that the episode was being“intensively investigated”by Austria’s Office for the Protection of the Constitution. While the authorities have stated that that the exact circumstances of the fire“are not yet known,”local media reports said police suspected arson, noting that flames appeared to have ignited in more than one location. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer also“strongly”condemned the incident in a statement, declaring that“anti-Semitism has no place in our society and will be fought with all political and legal means.”He went on to voice hopes that perpetrators of the cemetery attack would be“identified quickly.” The incident in Vienna follows a string of similar reports across Europe in recent weeks, amid renewed fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. Fears of violent reprisals against Jews have prompted evacuations and closures at a number of religious institutions, with several Jewish schools in Paris reportedly forced to clear out following bomb threats earlier this week. Jewish organizations have also warned of a rise in anti-Semitism in the US, where the Anti-Defamation League has reported a nearly 400% spike in such incidents this month."

New Zealand started the Rugby World Cup with a defeat to hosts France and a backlash of criticism, but now the All Blacks stand one victory away from a history-making fourth title. The 44-6 rout of Argentina in the semifinals on Friday sent the All Blacks into a record fifth final. Only a few weeks ago, observers wrote them off following a 35-7 hammering by South Africa just before the tournament and then a 27-13 defeat to Les Tricolores for a first-ever defeat in the pool stage. “Criticism and stuff, outside noise, we have become pretty good at blocking out,” captain Sam Cane said. “We trust the coaching staff immensely, we trust the plan. It feels like we’ve built nicely to this point.” Awaiting New Zealand in the final next weekend will be defending championsSouth Africa– also chasing title number four – or England. Their semifinal is on Saturday. “I’ll be watching it, probably have some popcorn. Couldn’t care who wins, to be honest,” New Zealand coach Ian Foster said. Going into the semifinal with Argentina, there was a question mark over whether the All Blacks could physically and mentally back up their astonishing herculean effort totopple Irelandin the quarterfinals. They did, outclassing an Argentina side trying to reach its first final. The All Blacks’ defence against the Pumas finished with 195 tackles, but 121 of them were in the first half when they missed only 10. That exhausted the Pumas, who threw everything at the All Blacks but were virtually out of the contest by halftime at 20-6 behind. As the game opened up more in the second spell, the All Blacks showed off their ruthlessness by building attacks and battering the Pumas to the point of tapping out. They led 39-6 going into the last quarter, when they just added a hat trick try for winger Will Jordan.      Jordan could have had a fourth try in the match but Richie Mo’unga ignored the overlap and chose to go on his own and was wrapped up. No matter, Jordan has a tournament-leading eight tries, matching the single tournament record set by Jonah Lomu in 1995, Bryan Habana in 2007 and Julian Savea in 2015. And Jordan has the final to come. Jordan’s overall record in an All Blacks’ jersey now stands at an incredible 31 tries in 30 matches. On Friday, he ran 105m, made seven ball carries, three-line breaks and broke three tackles. His first try started the rout but the last of the three was the best, putting a fitting seal on the victory, as he ran with ball in hand, chipped ahead and then sprinted past the defence to collect the ball and dive over. “He just showed how good he is at finishing things on,” said Foster.      It was the most lopsided semifinal result since 1987, when eventual champions New Zealand beat Wales 49-6, started with an early penalty for Argentina’s Emiliano Boffelli after they wasted 14 phases in the first two minutes. Hooker Julian Montoya, the Argentine captain, also paid tribute to New Zealand’s ruthless efficiency. “Every opportunity they have they score,” he said. “Awesome team.” The only downer for New Zealand was Scott Barrett’s yellow card with 15 minutes left for a cynical ruck foul and yet their discipline was still impressive. They conceded three penalties in the first half, seven in the match. The All Blacks draining the tension early on added to a subdued atmosphere at the 80,000-capacity Stade de France, which previously hosted Ireland matches packed with 40,000 green-shirted Irish fans singing their hearts out, or hopeful fans of three-time finalist France. New Zealand will take some stopping next weekend. “We are in a good spot, in the final, exactly where we wanted to be,” Cane said.          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Revealed by a 3D seismic image, the water lies two miles under the ocean floor off the coast of New Zealand, where it may be dampening a major earthquake fault that faces the country's North Island.Thefaultis known for producing slow-motion earthquakes, called slow slip events. These can release pent-up tectonic pressure harmlessly over days and weeks. Scientists want to know why they happen more often at some faults than others.Many slow slip earthquakes are thought to be linked to buried water. However, until now there was no direct geologic evidence to suggest such a large water reservoir existed at this particular New Zealand fault.""We can't yet see deep enough to know exactly the effect on the fault, but we can see that the amount of water that's going down here is actually much higher than normal,"" said the study's lead author, Andrew Gase, who did the work as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG).Theresearchwas publishedin the journalScience Advancesand is based on seismic cruises and scientific ocean drilling led by UTIG researchers.Gase, who is now a postdoctoral fellow at Western Washington University, is calling for deeper drilling to find where the water ends up so that researchers can determine whether it affects pressure around the fault—an important piece of information that could lead to more precise understanding of large earthquakes, he said.The Hikurangi plateau is a remnant of a series of epic volcanic eruptions that began 125 million years ago in the Pacific Ocean. A recent seismic survey (red rectangle) led by the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics imaged the plateau as it sinks into New Zealand’s Hikurangi subduction zone (red line). Credit: Andrew GaseThe site where the researchers found the water is part of a vast volcanic province that formed when a plume of lava the size of the United States breached the Earth's surface in the Pacific Ocean 125 million years ago. The event was one of the Earth's largest knownvolcanic eruptionsand rumbled on for several million years.Gase used seismic scans to build a 3D picture of the ancient volcanic plateau in which he saw thick, layered sediments surrounding buried volcanoes. His UTIG collaborators ran lab experiments on drill core samples of the volcanic rock and found that water made up nearly half of its volume.""Normal ocean crust, once it gets to be about 7 or 10 million years old should contain much less water,"" he said. The ocean crust in the seismic scans was ten times as old, but it had remained much wetter.Gase speculates that the shallow seas where the eruptions took place eroded some of the volcanoes into a porous, broken-up rock that stored water like an aquifer as it was buried. Over time, the rock and rock fragments transformed into clay, locking in even more water.The finding is important because scientists think that underground water pressure may be a key ingredient in creating conditions that release tectonic stress via slow slip earthquakes. This usually happens when water-rich sediments are buried with the fault, trapping the water underground. However, the New Zealand fault contains little of this typical ocean sediment. Instead, the researchers think the ancient volcanoes and the transformed rocks—now clays—are carrying large volumes ofwaterdown as they're swallowed by the fault.A seismic image of the Hikurangi plateau reveals details about the Earth’s interior and what it’s made of. The blue-green layer under the yellow line shows water buried within rocks. Researchers at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics think the water could be dampening earthquakes at the nearby Hikurangi subduction zone. Credit: Andrew GaseUTIG Director Demian Saffer, a study co-author and co-chief scientist on the scientific drilling mission, said the findings suggest that otherearthquakefaults around the globe could be in similar situations.""It's a really clear illustration of the correlation between fluids and the style of tectonic fault movement—including earthquake behavior,"" he said. ""This is something that we've hypothesized fromlab experiments, and is predicted by somecomputer simulations, but there are very few clear field experiments to test this at the scale of a tectonic plate."""

Aotearoa New Zealand is a biodiversity hotspot for deepwater coral—approximately one sixth of the known deep-water coral species of the world have been recorded in our waters.Deep-water corals are under threat due to ocean warming and acidification due to climate change as well as from the physical impacts of bottom trawling. Deep-water corals are ecologically important because they provide critical benthic structure for other species. Fish live inside their reefs and some of these reefs can extend large distances, covering hundreds of square kilometers. These reefs are also significant sites of carbon and nitrogen mineralization.New researchfrom Sustainable Seas National Science Challenge, published inJournal of Environmental Management, looks atmarine conservationfor deep-water corals to assess the impact of bottom trawling oncoralhabitats now and the effectiveness for protecting these habitats in the future. The findings show that bottom trawling impacts all coral taxa, but particularly reef-forming corals. Habitats will also decline in the future due to a changing climate.""When designing protection for these coral with the usual approach, our study found that spatial marine protection is unlikely to provide enough conservation for deep-water corals in the future, due to shifts associated with climate change and fishing,"" says lead researcher Fabrice Stephenson.The research identifies new areas for spatial marine protection that can provide protection for corals against a changing climate while still giving refuge to current populations. This is particularly important given the predicted reduction in coral habitat due to the cumulative effects ofclimate changeand bottom trawling.""Our results demonstrate the considerable risks associated with developing effective marine protected areas that do not account for combining current and future stressors,"" says Fabrice. ""While deep-water corals in New Zealand illustrate this, the same approach is equally applicable to othermarine speciesand for other locations.""It takes decades, if not centuries, for some species of deep-water coral to recover."

Tom Robinson, 24, hoped to become the youngest person to complete the feat. He was found sitting on top of his boat with no clothes on, 100 nautical miles south-west off the coast of Vanuatu, a post on his website said. Local media reports say he was treated for sunburn and dehydration aboard the ship, but is in otherwise good health. Mr Robinson's record-breaking attempt began when he set off from Peru in July last year. He was hoping to arrive in Cairns, Australia, by December. He was on the last leg of his trip, after leaving the city of Luganville in Vanuatu on Monday. Speaking to ABC Australia from the country last week, Mr Robinson had said this final part of the journey would be the ""make-or-break leg"". It is not yet clear what caused his boat to overturn on Thursday evening, but his emergency distress beacon was activated, which alerted the authorities. Early on Friday morning, the P&O Pacific Explorer helped free Mr Robinson from the water, and he climbed up a rope ladder to reach the deck, according to the post on his website. Local media reports say the ship had taken a 200km (124 miles) detour to help with the rescue. In a statement, Mr Robinson thanked the crew of the ship ""whose seamanship and professionalism ensured a safe rescue"". Tamu Tapaitau, a member of the team supporting him on his attempt, said that the cruise ship was heading to Auckland in New Zealand, and from there Mr Robinson would fly home to Brisbane."

But back then, the New Zealander of Indian origin did not imagine that his dreams would one day turn him into the country’s most sought-after mathematics teacher. Auckland-based Chandar, 41, live-streams mathematics lessons from his home in the evenings, available to anyone who wants to learn, on his YouTube account called ‘Infinity Plus One’. Local press in New Zealand call him an “internet sensation”, but the tags given to him by the thousands of students who tune into his lessons every week likely matter more. Chandar helps students with their NCEA mathematics, or the National Certificate of Educational Achievement, New Zealand’s main secondary school qualification for students aged between 15 to 16, equivalent to the Class 10 board examinations in India. “You are seriously a lifesaver. Our teacher has taught us nothing this year but your videos have helped so much and I have improved soo much!! i went from getting achieveds to excellences because of your videos (sic),” writes YouTube user @eleanor5058 under a video posted in August, on infinityplusone’s YouTube page. “This guys basically just my teacher at this point, my math teacher shows us like nothing i swear (sic),” writes @esmoesmoesmo, another user on the same video. Almost a decade ago, in 2013, while working as a mathematics teacher at Ormiston Senior College in Auckland, Chandar started hisvideo tutorials. “The students would come and ask me the exact same question six times in one day. They were all learning things when they were ready because you can’t expect all 30 kids to be ready at the same time. One day, I had six different kids come asking the same question within hours. So I told them, ‘I should have a camera above me and record this so that you can watch it whenever you want.’ The kids asked, ‘Why don’t you do it?’” The students also recommended YouTube as a publishing platform for these videos that would be easy for them to access. That was where the idea of these online tutorials was formed, says Chandar. When Chandar first started his video tutorials, he began addressing some common questions and problems that students in his classes were facing. “We were solving exam papers, talking about how to tackle grades, and I then thought about doing an exam walk-through video for national exams,” says Chandar. Those videos went viral in New Zealand; being a relatively small country, word got around quickly of the free resources that Chandar was providing. Post-2016, Chandar’s contributions towards the teaching of mathematics began to get recognised, with him being awarded for his work by the New Zealand Association of Mathematics Teachers, which helped his work get more visibility. In 2018, he conducted the first live-stream of his classes during the middle of the week involving preparation for examinations, where 500 students joined. “Kids were sending questions on Instagram,Facebookand email,” says Chandar, in addition to sending in questions in the comments box in the YouTube videos. By then, he had already realised that his tutorials were helping kids in ways that he had not even imagined when he first started. “I wasn’t charging anything. A lot of students felt that you had to pay to attend the YouTube tutorial, but it’s a link and it’s free,” he says. Four years ago, Chandar began teaching mathematics at Ormiston Junior College in Auckland. “When I put up these tutorials, the people who come, they come by choice. It’s on a playlist, so if someone couldn’t attend a session, they can still visit and attend it in their own time.” “You are doing what my maths teacher cannot do. Thanks a lot!” says a comment in one of Chandar’s Algebra tutorials from August. Comments on Chandar’s online tutorials indicate that the success of his work has more to do with his ability to connect with students and explain complex theories and concepts in an easy and relatable way to students requiring assistance with the subject, rather than being a reflection of the gaps in the school education system in New Zealand. But Chandar believes that the popularity of his work has much to do with the fact that these students are consciously choosing to attend his classes to learn. “If your child is not ready to learn, nothing is going to work. When I put up these tutorials, the people who come, they come by choice.” For some time now, between July to November, Chandar has been live-streaming his classes up to four times a week, directed mostly towards students preparing for their Mathematics Common Assessment Tasks (MCAT) examinations. Chandar logs in during the evenings after his child has gone to sleep, to help students who tune in from all over the country. “In September the year eleven students have their first MCAT exams. I start teaching for this from the month of July. If students don’t pass this, they don’t get to do the next level of STEM subjects. So their career pathway can take a huge trajectory depending on this exam,” explains Chandar. In 2018, Chandar began noticing something interesting: his audiences began including students from outside New Zealand. “A major subscriber base after New Zealand is the United States and then India in third place,” he says. That coincided with Chandar experimenting with pushing out his tutorials as YouTube shorts. Statistics that Chandar shared withindianexpress.comshowed that while he has 3 million views from New Zealand, he has had 200,000 lifetime views from India alone; big numbers for a niche, basic YouTube channel geared towards students wanting to specifically learn mathematics. “That just showed me that Indians were consuming the content that I was creating asYouTube shorts. It was quite interesting to watch that,” says Chandar. As a 12-year-old who moved fromChennai, Tamil Nadu to a foreign land, Chandar had little reason to believe that his work would contribute to the lives of students in this way and bring so much in return – accolades, recognition and satisfaction in having done a job that he loves well. “At 18, I told my mum that I didn’t want to be an engineer but a teacher, and I remember the shock from mum and dad.” While Chandar’s mother was a maths professor in Chennai and later on a maths teacher in a local New Zealand school when the family relocated to the country, it was not the path she wanted for her son. “But I was dead set on being a teacher at 18. She wasn’t happy with my choice because teaching is a hard profession. The respect that came automatically with teaching in India didn’t come the same way in New Zealand. It was different. It had to do with how they value education in various countries. Mum said, ‘It’s a hard profession in New Zealand, do something else’.” Academic setbacks that he faced during college did not help, requiring him to complete his college education in five years instead of the standard three. “It was some of the lowest points of my life when I was trying to understand how the world works and trying to understand how to study and trying to understand how to survive. I did a bachelor’s in Mathematics but I was horrible at it and failed so many papers. So there were many hurdles to jump through,” says Chandar. “A lot of people told me, ‘How are you going to get a degree? How are you going to be a maths teacher?’ But I wanted to do it because it was something that kept me happy,” he says. The adversities were temporary and likely helped him empathise with and understand students struggling with the subject. These days, he often runs into students, one of the many hundreds who attend his online classes, whom he does not necessarily recognise by name or face, only to be told how much the tutorials have helped and how the classes allowed them to pursue educational and career opportunities. “You are doing what my maths teacher cannot do. Thanks a lot!” says a comment in one of Chandar’s Algebra tutorials from August 2023. When asked why he named his YouTube channel and tutorials ‘infinityplusone’, Chandar says, it is a private story, one that depends on who asks the question.

[+] Williamson after winning the Final of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 between New Zealand and England at Lord's Cricket Ground on July 14, 2019 in London, England. (Photo by Gareth Copley-ICC/ICC via Getty Images) There has been a distinct lack of close contests so far in the 2023 Cricket World Cup, but the final four years ago holds a special place in the annals of ODI history. One of the most enduring images of that day at Lord’s, apart from the iconic commentary by Ian Smith on the very last ball, was the image of both teams on the pitch together at the end of the game. England won the match, but New Zealand won respect for the way they carried themselves. ""After we lifted the trophy and did a lap of honour, both teams were on the outfield with family, friends, kids, interacting, talking the whole time,"" England skipper Eoin Morgan recounted. A few months later, the Kiwis won the Christopher Martin-Jenkins Spirit of Cricket Award. Captain Kane Williamson later spoke of how hard it might be to get over the dramatic defeat, but he was lauded for the way he handled himself and the team in the aftermath by the president of the MCC, Kumar Sangakkara. “The New Zealand team are worthy winners of this award. In the heat of battle, they displayed a level of sportsmanship that was fitting for such a fantastic final and indeed tournament,” the former Sri Lanka captain said at the time. “It is a testament to their squad that even after a match that will live long in the memory of the cricket that was played, we are still talking about the spirit of cricket. Their actions deserve this recognition.” Even England’s hero of the hour, Ben Stokes, quickly summoned respect and regret for the vanquished after a throw from Martin Guptill hit his bat and shot through to the boundary in a freak incident. Without that huge twist of fate, it was almost certain that the Black Caps would have won the trophy. “Playing against New Zealand is always a good event; they are good lads. I will be apologising to Kane for the rest of my life (the overthrow that added four runs). It was written in the stars to happen for us,"" said Stokes. Compare this reaction to Stokes's rather offhand description of how Australia and England managed to avoid each other for beers during the end of this summer's epic Ashes series. Williamson had more practice at being a gracious runner-up when the Kiwis lost the 2021 World T20 final against Australia. Nevertheless, he embraced David Warner, a teammate in the IPL, for his part in the victory, with a smile on both men’s faces. Williamson doesn’t do the sullen look. Warner is a little less inclined to show such restraint when things don't go his way. New Zealand are an open book, a team that has no egos but a wider, almost old-fashioned ethic. Daryl Mitchell embodies the accessibility and down-to-earth nature of the team. When Mitchell’s six landed in a female fan’s beer during the Lord’s Test in 2022, he sought out the fan in question to apologise. He also won the Spirit of Cricket Award in 2021 for refusing to take a single against England in a tight World T20 semi-final after accidentally blocking Adil Rashid. “At the end of the day, it is just a game, and it is a game that we all love, and we are very lucky to be able to do that in the right way,” Mitchell mused. Some teams have mantras that are just echoed out without feeling or as a stock response. The Kiwis could be playing in the backyard or a World Test Championship final and it would be hard to notice the difference. DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - NOVEMBER 14: David Warner of Australia and Kane Williamson interact ... [+] following the ICC Men's T20 World Cup final match between New Zealand and Australia at Dubai International Stadium on November 14, 2021 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Michael Steele-ICC/ICC via Getty Images) There has been a general mellowing of relationships between teams (sledging—what sledging?) probably helped by the mix of players in IPL franchises. Even so, it would be hard to think of a situation created by the New Zealanders that would lead to a controversy like the Jonny Bairstow stumping in the Ashes. Their Antipodean neighbours may have won four World Cups, but it has been Australia's little brother that has set the standards for behaviour that all sports teams could follow. New Zealand are not necessarily 'good' losers; they are as desperate to win as any side. It's their ability to treat those two famous impostors just the same which is admirable."

Vinnell (Massey University, Wellington), Professor Taciano L. Milfont (University of Waikato, Tauranga) and Emeritus Professor John McClure (Victoria University of Wellington), recentlypublishedinSocial Psychological Bulletin.Having surveyed 604 people in Wellington, New Zealand, the team concludedpublic communication, meant to encourage risk-reduction behavior, should rather opt for the termnatural hazard. While a hazard denotes a potential fornegative consequences, a disaster implies that these negative consequences are inevitable, the researchers argue.In recent years, there has been a debate about replacing the term natural disaster with an alternative that would better communicate the role of humans in the devastating impacts of natural events, for example, living near fault lines or overlooking building regulations. Previously, in a similar manner,global warmingwas replaced with climate change, which has reportedly led to wider belief and intentions to act.Calling disasters natural puts the blame on nature and downplays the role of people's choices, the researchers explain. While some argue that we should simply drop the word natural and instead refer only to disasters, there is little evidence that the public actually interpret the term in this way. Instead, the team fears, the proposed solution would simply mix disasters such as earthquakes together with the likes of nuclear plant meltdowns, terrorism and pandemics.So, the team set out to explore whether it would make a difference if they talked to people about preparing for natural hazards instead of natural disasters.As part of their study, the researchers measured key factors related to preparation, including social norms, beliefs about whether preparing is helpful, and perceived ability to undertake preparation actions. Interestingly, scores on these factors did not differ significantly when the people were asked about natural hazards and about natural disasters. Thus, the researchers concluded that the terms don't have much, if any, impact on key perceptions.However, when the team asked questions about factors related to one's intentions to prepare—one of the best predictors of actual behavior—they found a significant difference in the responses when they used natural hazards instead of natural disasters.""Perhaps most importantly, we found that intentions to prepare for natural hazards predicted actual behavior, but intentions to prepare fornatural disastersdidn't,"" say the researchers.""In terms of the bigger picture, these mixed findings show that we need more evidence on how the general public understands the terms we use, and that it should be this evidence, which drives our word choices when we communicate.""To explain the rationale behind their research topic, the team reminds us that, ""the impacts of disasters (triggered by natural hazards) have been increasing through a combination of population growth, rendering more people and property vulnerable in risk-prone areas, and an increase in the frequency and severity of high-impact weather events, particularly those driven by climate change.""""Every year, over $500 billion is lost from theglobal economyas a result, and between 1998 to 2017, over a billion people were impacted by disasters resulting fromnatural hazards, including over a million fatalities. It is therefore vital that we find the best ways to reduce this harm."""
Business Insider,Zoe Burt,"'Girl math' is toxic and it could be holding women back from growing wealth, says a financial specialist",A financial-content specialist breaks down why the TikTok trend #girlmath is damaging to women's financial well-being.,https://www.businessinsider.com/why-girl-math-toxic-tiktok-trend-2023-10,https://i.insider.com/65295e396561dd877e7a09f1?width=1200&format=jpeg,2023-10-18 09:12:15.000000,"Money in the MetaverseWe Are/Getty Images
<ul><li>Zoe Burt, a wealth advisor turned financial-content specialist, doesn't think she's good at math.</li><li>To Burt, the viral TikTok trend #girlmath … [+6080 chars]",New Zealand,"Women are constantly being reminded that math is not for them. Sometimes it's subliminal: a young woman scanning a sea of male faces in her STEM lecture. But often it's more overt, as with TikTok's most recent viral trend: ""girl math."" The stereotype runs deeper than many of us even realize. As I was bombarded with #girlmath videos, it hit me that I don't consider myself to be ""good"" at math. Though I didn't get a degree in STEM, I achieved high math grades in school. I studied hard to become a qualified wealth advisor in both the UK and the US — a first for my company at the time. But still, not good at math. And then, even with a whole host of qualifications to confirm my financial and mathematical skills, when a friend saw my trading app he asked, ""Does your boyfriend pick those investments for you?"" My boyfriend is an engineer, with no financial experience or qualifications. The comment had no malice but jolted me to the ingrained stereotype. Even when women are qualified and experienced in numbers, TikTok tells its audience that girls aren't mathematically capable. The trend pokes fun at irresponsible personal-finance habits, dubbing them girl math. TikTok creators explain to their audiences that #girlmath meansa purchase is free if you pay for it in cash you didn't remember you had, thatnot spending $50 on some shorts you wanted to buy is basically the same as making $50, and — most concerningly — thata purchase is free when it's on your credit card. According to the Evening Standard,the trend emergedafter a clip of hosts on the New Zealand radio station FVHZMwent viral on TikTok. The clip was of the show's segment in which female listeners call in to justify their big purchases with the excuse of ""girl maths."" The TikTok video spurred a wave of videos in response with women discussing how they justified spending that could be viewed as impractical. Seemingly lighthearted, the hashtag plays into a damaging stereotype that women are bad at math. The Institute for Fiscal Studies found in the UK in 2018 that more girls than boys received A-level certifications – but female students made uponly 39% of math A-level results, and 22% of physics results. The imbalance in women studying math-based topics is reiterated in higher education. UCAS data shows non-male students – participants who identified as women or nonbinary – only made up31% of students studying mathematicsat universities in the UK. But historically, women have excelled in mathematics. Caroline Criado Perez, the author of ""Invisible Women,"" highlights Dainan Tamina, a female mathematician who solved a complex problem that had eluded mathematicians for centuries in 1997. Shakuntala Devi holds a world record forperforming the ""fastest human computation."" We've got evidence of female mathematicians solving some of the world's greatest problems, yet #girlmath perpetuates the belief women just aren't mathsy. The #girlmath trend focuses on ""feminine"" spending habits as lavish — another common stereotype of women and money management. A Guardian report found that65% of financial articles directed at womencharacterized them as ""splurgers"" and sought to teach them how to rein in their wild feminine spending tendencies. This content usually revolves around childlike images of piggy banks, or simplified techniques of stretching budgets ever further. Stereotyping women as having poor maths skills has a direct correlation with an unwillingness to engage with finances. A 2021 study in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization suggests the stereotype that women are less financially literate increases their anxiety around money. In a 2021 study of 2,400 American adults making an annual income of $50,000 or more, Fidelity found only a third of female participants said they were confident in their ability to invest. Even though a Fidelity analysis of 5 million of its customers from a recent 10-year period found that women actually slightly outperformed men. In response to #girlmath, the trend #boymath has also started to emerge. This trend appears to balance the perceived financial illiteracy scales. ""Boy math"" was defined by one X user as ""paying $44 billion for a $25 billion company and, through business smarts and entrepreneurial know-how, turning it into an $8.8 billion company."" The tweet alludes to Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, which he rebranded to X. It is worth noting that the boy-math trend seems to illustrate illogical male behavior in a more general sense, whereas girl math is pointedly financial. When the trend's negative spotlight is directed toward men, it avoids conflating men with poor financial habits. The girl-math trend brings women's financial literacy and investing into the limelight. Though the trend itself perpetuates negative stereotypes, it opens up discussions around gender and financial well-being. Why do women cede financial responsibility to their male counterparts? Why do womensave less on average? Most of these debates boil down to the gender pay gap and continued systemic misogyny. So, while TikTok trends like #girlmath may seem funny and fleeting, the stereotypes and systems they play into are not. Zoe Burtis a financial content specialist forFemale Invest.

According to the report, around 1.3 million Indian students are studying abroad in 2023, with Andhra Pradesh /Telangana, Punjab and Maharashtra as the top Indian states for outgoing students. The report titled “Beyond Beds & Boundaries: Indian Student Mobility Report, 2023,” offers insights into the dynamics of Indian students pursuing higher education abroad, with a particular focus on the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. The report highlighted that recently other countries including Germany, Kyrgyzstan, Ireland, Singapore, Russia, Philippines, France, and New Zealand have also emerged as preferred destinations for studying abroad. Traditionally, Indian students have preferred countries like US, Canada, UK and Australia. Punjab, Andhra Pradesh/ Telangana and Maharashtra are the top states in India in terms of students going abroad, the report said adding that 12.5 per cent each from all these states contribute to the number of students going abroad followed by Gujarat,Delhiand Tamil Nadu with 8 per cent each and Karnataka at 6 per cent. Other states combined is 33 per cent, the report said. The report also provides a detailed analysis of the financial aspects of studying abroad, shedding light on the substantial expenses incurred by Indian students. This analysis highlighted the economic impact of Indian student mobility and also underscored the pressing need for targeted financial support and scholarships. This report addressed the difficulties faced by Indian students in finding suitable accommodation in their destination countries, emphasising the complexities of securing appropriate living conditions and the necessity for streamlined processes and support services to alleviate these challenges. Governments across the world need to put in place a national housing strategy, establish a clear, comprehensive, and coordinated approach to addressing the student housing problem through setting national goals for student housing availability and affordability, establishing guidelines for local student housing policies, and providing funding and resources for student housing initiatives, the report suggested."

Her colleagues in Utrecht had predicted its existence over 10 years ago based on fragments of old tectonic plates found deep in the Earth's mantle. Van de Lagemaat reconstructed lost plates through field research and detailed investigations of the mountain belts of Japan, Borneo, the Philippines, New Guinea, and New Zealand.To her surprise, she found that oceanic remnants on northern Borneo must have belonged to the long-suspected plate, which scientists have named Pontus. She has now reconstructed the entire plate in its full glory. The work has been published inGondwana Research.Understanding the movements of the tectonic plates that make up the Earth's rigid outer shell is essential to understand the planet's geological history. The movements of these plates strongly influenced how the planet's paleogeography and climate have changed over time, and even where to find rare metals. But large oceanic plates from the geological past have since disappeared into the Earth's mantle by means of subduction. They have left behind only fragments of rock hidden in mountain belts.Van de Lagemaat studied the planet's most complicated plate tectonic region: the area around the Philippines. ""The Philippines is located at a complex junction of different plate systems. The region almost entirely consists of oceanic crust, but some pieces are raised above sea level, and show rocks of very different ages.""Utrecht University geologist Suzanna van de Lagemaat has reconstructed a massive and previously unknown tectonic plate that was once one-quarter the size of the Pacific Ocean. Her colleagues in Utrecht had already predicted the existence of the plate years ago, based on fragments of old tectonic plates found deep in the earth’s mantle. Van de Lagemaat reconstructed lost plates through field research and detailed investigations of the mountains of Japan, Borneo, the Philippines, New Guinea and New Zealand. To her astonishment, she found that oceanic remnants on northern Borneo must have belonged to the long-suspected plate, which scientists have named Pontus. She has now reconstructed the entire plate in its full glory. Credit: Suzanna van de Lagemaat/Utrecht UniversityReconstructionUsing geological data, Van de Lagemaat first reconstructed the movements of the current plates in the region between Japan and New Zealand. That revealed how large the area was of plates that must have disappeared in the current western Pacific region.""We also conductedfield workon northern Borneo, where we found the most important piece of the puzzle. We thought we were dealing with relicts of a lost plate that we already knew about. But our magnetic lab research on those rocks indicated that our finds were originally from much farther north, and had to be remnants of a different, previously unknown plate.""But the important realization was yet to come. ""11 years ago, we thought that the remnants of Pontus might lie in northern Japan, but we'd since refuted that theory,"" explains Douwe van Hinsbergen, Van de Lagemaat's Ph.D. supervisor. ""It was only after Suzanna had systematically reconstructed half of the 'Ring of Fire' mountain belts from Japan, through New Guinea, to New Zealand that the proposed Pontus plate revealed itself, and it included the rocks we studied on Borneo.""Relics and wavesThe relics of Pontus are not only located on northern Borneo, but also on Palawan, an island in the Western Philippines, and in the South China Sea. Van de Lagemaat's research also showed that a single coherent plate tectonic system stretched from southern Japan to New Zealand, and it must have existed for at least 150 million years. That is also a new discovery in the field.The previous predictions of the existence of Pontus were made possible because a subducted plate leaves behind traces when it 'sinks' into the Earth's mantle: zones in the mantle with anomalous temperatures or compositions. These anomalies can be observed when seismographs pick up signals from earthquakes.Earthquakes send waves through Earth's interior, and when they travel through an anomaly, such as a fragment from an old plate, the anomaly produces a disruption of the signal. Geologists can trace these disruptions to the existence of phenomena in the mantle, such as fragments of tectonic plates. That allows them to look 300 million years into the past; older plate fragments have 'dissolved' at the boundary between the mantle and the core.Astudyfrom 11 years ago showed that a large subduction zone must have run through the western paleo-Pacific Ocean, which separated the known Pacific plates in the east from the hypothetical Pontus plate in the west. This hypothesis has now been independently demonstrated by Van de Lagemaat's research."

(Photo by Matthew Lewis-ICC/ICC via Getty Images) Despite reaching the finals at the last two 50-overs World Cups, some fans and critics still view New Zealand as the underdogs. For stand-in captain Tom Latham that is not a cause for concern at this year’s World Cup in India as his team is focused on playing their best brand of cricket. New Zealand take on defending champions England in the World Cup opener in Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi Stadium on Thursday – a replay of the 2019 final, where England lifted the trophy, having won the drama-packed match on the account of hitting more boundaries. Despite their good form in one-day internationals in recent times, New Zealand are not seen as the title contenders. Fans and critics have selected India, Australia and England as their top three picks to lift the trophy. Asked why the two-time finalists are still viewed as underdogs, Latham told reporters on Wednesday: “That's probably something for you guys (media) to decide, but as I said, we don't necessarily focus on that. Kiwis fly under the radar a little bit and go about our business in the way that we want to. “Every team has a different brand that they like to play, a style that they like to play in, and we have ours. We know if we do that and we play to the best of our ability then we are hard to beat on the day.” New Zealand have a good mix of youth and experience in their World Cup squad, with some players gearing up for their fourth World Cup appearance while some will be making their World Cup debut. “So, for us, it's about trying to play our brand of cricket as best we can and if we can do that then hopefully give ourselves a good chance at the back end of the tournament,” Latham added.

[+] session at Narendra Modi Stadium on October 04, 2023 in Ahmedabad, India. (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images) New Zealand will be without their usual captain and key batsman Kane Williamson in the opener against England as he continues his recovery from a knee injury. Williamson, who underwent surgery for a torn anterior cruciate ligament in April, had been doubtful to make the cut for the World Cup squad but has shown good progress in recent times. He batted in their two warm-up games ahead of the tournament, but will skip the match against England as a precaution. “We'd certainly be better off having him (Williamson) but I think from our point of view for him to be here, to be at the World Cup, is a testament to the work that he's put on over the last four to five months to be where he is,” Latham said. “I think it's nearly six months post-surgery and for him to be given a shot, to be given a chance to play in the World Cup at some point is really a testament to the work that he's put in. So for him, it's a day-by-day process in terms of where his recovery is at. “He's obviously played a little bit of a part in the last two warm-up games. You know he's been batting beautifully which is great to see and he was out in the field a couple of days ago so he's progressing really nicely and fingers crossed he's on the park sooner rather than later.” ‘Amazing Opportunity’ A view of the Narendra Modi Stadium ahead of the 2023 ICC men's cricket World Cup, in Ahmedabad on ...

(Photo by Punit PARANJPE / AFP) (Photo by PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images) Playing Thursday’s match in Ahmedabad in a 132,000-capacity stadium, the biggest in world cricket, will be an “amazing opportunity”, said Latham. The world’s biggest cricket stadium, renamed after India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, also held the final of the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Twenty20 tournament earlier this year. “I've just arrived at this grounds, the first time I've been here and walking across the ground it's pretty special and talking to some of the guys that have played the IPL games here they've certainly said it's an amazing place to play cricket, especially in front of a packed house,” Latham said. “So, we're really excited to play the opening game of the World Cup here against a quality opposition and I think from our point of view, as I said earlier, the World Cup always seems a long way away, but for it to finally be here is really cool.”"

After graduating from college in 2020, the 23-year-old started working as an account executive at a public-relations firm in New Zealand. He went into the office four times a week — and enjoyed every second of it. But at the beginning of 2021, Fitchett upended his work situation and moved to Los Angeles. When he got there, he was told his job would be fully remote. The account executive worked eight hours a day, five days a week from his apartment. It didn't take long for feelings of isolation to bubble to the surface. Fitchett, a self-described extrovert, said he longed for over-the-desk chats and lunch with his coworkers. The lack of interaction left him feeling drained and like he was missing out on building meaningful connections with his coworkers. ""I just felt like I was almost trapped between these four walls,"" Fitchett, who has since returned to the office part-time, told Insider. Young professionals such as Fitchett are facing a loneliness epidemic that years of working from home have exacerbated. While loneliness can arise at home or in a crowded office, research shows that the onset of remote work has heightened the challenges of staying connected with coworkers. Astudy of more than 60,000 Microsoft employeeswho transitioned from office work to remote work during the pandemic said that they felt ""more siloed, less dynamic,"" and unable to form as many new relationships when they were working from home. ""There is a growing recognition that the workplace has become more socially isolating over the past few years with the pandemic,"" Aaron Terrazas, the chief economist at the job-review site Glassdoor, told Insider. The solitude of remote work seemed to particularly hit Gen Z workers — who began their careers as workplaces went from in-person to virtual — hard. In a 2021study commissioned by Cigna, 79% of surveyed young adults aged 18 to 24 reported feeling lonely, compared to 41% of surveyed seniors aged 66 and older. ""Humans are by nature social creatures, and in the past, we have naturally formed groups and bonds in-person via work and social activities,"" Hubert Palan, the 45-year-old CEO of the product-management company Productboard, told Insider over email. ""Company leaders need to help Gen Z — as well as millennials, whose workplace experience was hugely disrupted by Covid — to build strong interpersonal workplace relationships."" His company has more than 400 employees, many of whom are in remote roles, and Palan has observed younger remote workers can miss out on the emotional aspects of the in-person workplace. Unaddressed loneliness can have serious consequences. In May,Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general, declared""loneliness, isolation, and lack of connection"" across the country as a public-health crisis, noting that loneliness is associated with cardiovascular disease, dementia, stroke, depression, anxiety, and premature death. Insider spoke to more than a dozen Gen Z workers between the ages of 22 and 26 working in white-collar industries such as tech, public relations, and consulting about how remote work has shaped their feelings of loneliness. Several said it's been harder to develop meaningful relationships with their colleagues — connections that experts have said could be beneficial to their mental health and careers down the line. These workers also said remote work has increased anxiety, lowered morale, and curtailed opportunities for career advancement. Of course, not everyone wants to return to the office, or do so all the time. But when it comes to alleviating loneliness, in-person work may be the best medicine. Gen Z workers said that solitary remote work has taken a toll on their professional development and sense of work-life balance. In a study coming out later this year, Mansoor Soomro, a workplace researcher at Teesside University in the UK, surveyed 2,000 Gen Z workers across countries and industries to understand the most pressing challenges they face in their jobs. Soomro found that many surveyed Gen Z workers with remote jobs felt a sense of ""isolation"" from their coworkers and, in turn, believed they missed out on networking opportunities. He expects these challenges could potentially lead to elevated feelings of stress and anxiety, inconsistent productivity levels, and an inability to merge well with company culture. With companies asking —and in some cases mandating— their employees return to the office, Gen Z workers who are going in regularly have said they have a renewed sense of confidence in their jobs. Juanita Garcia only realized how remote work impeded her professional development when she transitioned from a remote role to a hybrid role this past June. The 23-year-old — who is based in New York and works for the government — said she struggled at first with workplace etiquette. She wasn't sure about what to bring for lunch or when to eat it, and wondered whether it was appropriate to go get a coffee or stop at a coworker's desk to ask questions. But she also realized how lonely her job was when she was working from home. ""I was in constant communication, but I didn't actually have people around me who were willing and able to chat and talk and help,"" she told Insider. Now that Garcia has settled into her new job, she said being in the office has given her an opportunity to observe her higher-ups and has increased her own sense of ambition. ""I'm around people who've done great things and who are now my mentors,"" she said. ""I can talk to them all the time, and I can see them working hard."" The same rings true for Fitchett. When working from home, Fitchett said he felt like he missed out on professional-development opportunities. Since Fitchett's employer started mandating employees go to the office, Fitchett said he finally feels a sense of ease at his job. He said he ""loves"" the interactions he has in the office — whether that's asking a coworker sitting next to him a question or participating in a group brainstorming session — and that they boost both his productivity and morale. He now goes into the office up to four times a week, even though his company only requires employees to come in two days. ""When I'm in the office, it's easier for me to kind of just stay on track,"" Fitchett said. Many Gen Zers who still work remote roles are seeking connections outside the office, choosing to work from coffee shops, coworking spaces, or libraries. Anita Pan — who works remotely as a developer at a ""no-code"" app agency — moved from New York to Washington, DC in 2021, just a year out of college. The 25-year-old struggled with working remotely, especially in a new city.Remote work exacerbated her social anxiety, she said, and she found herself overanalyzing interactions she wouldn't have thought twice about in college. She tried working from Starbucks, joining a climbing gym, and renting a room at a WeWork location, but the new settings didn't ease her loneliness. She now works an additional 10 hours a week — outside of her full-time job — as a receptionist at the Pilates studio Solidcore. The experience is helping her overcome her anxiety and foster new connections. ""My job is to make the studio a very welcoming place where people make conversations with clients, build community with clients,"" Pan said. ""You're forced to get out of your shell and start relating to people."" Others are turning to a handful of startups dedicated to helping remote workers stave off loneliness through virtual-coworking spaces. Ricky Yean is the founder Flow Club, a Y Combinator-backed virtual-coworking space that aims to help remote workers stay on task. He said that Gen Zers — especially those without offices — make up the majority of the platform's users. Staying motivated and productive, Yean argues, are not problems that stem from a lack of willpower or discipline — they come from loneliness. ""The fact that they're showing up and sitting next to you doing something you don't know much about creates this feeling that we're in this together,"" Yean told Insider. There's more that goes into a worker's preferences than loneliness, andGen Z workers are mixedabout returning to the office full time. Areport from Dellreleased last December that surveyed 15,105 people between the ages of 18 and 26 across 15 countries found that 29% of respondents look for the ability to work remotely when they apply for jobs, while another 29% said they prefer nine-to-five office-based roles. Working from the office can be expensive. A recent study found that the typical hybrid workerspends an average of $51per day — $36 more than they spend on a day they work from home — when they go into the office on things such as commuting, parking, and food.Remote workers can also spend less on housingby moving to more affordable locations farther away from big cities. There are other reasons some prefer remote work. Studies have shown that somepeople of colorprefer working from home toescape workplace racism.Workers with disabilitiesmay be able to better accommodate their needs from home, andLGBTQ+ employees are more likely to leavea job if there's no remote option.The ability to work from home has also led to arecord number of women in the workforce. Plus, some workers say they're more productive when working from home. Bianca Wu, a 23-year-old tax consultant at PwC based in the Bay Area, was required to work in the office once a week as of last December. Even though Wu, who felt ""super lonely"" working from home, found making connections with people in an office ""so much more personable,"" she prefers to work remotely when she can. As someone with ADHD, Wu said she focuses better at home because the office environment can be distracting. On days when she did go into the office, she found it pointless when nobody on her team — including her boss — was there. ""Even though there's a mandate to come into the office, still a lot of people wouldn't go,"" Wu, who now works from home full-time after switching teams, said. ""So then it's like, why are we here if the important people that need to come into the office aren't coming in?"" For her — and many other Gen Z workers — the solution may come in some form of flexibility. Even though Fitchett enjoys being in the office, he said he likes having the option to change his scenery occasionally. ""At the age that I'm at now, I want that flexibility to be able to jump between an office and home and switching it up a little bit,"" he said. To that point, Soomro said that Gen Z workers would like to continue having the flexibility to work remotely — and are willing to quit their jobs to keep that perk: ""This is the generation that will come out first saying, 'If you're not offering remote work or hybrid work, I'm ready to move.'"""

Discover the full list:https://t.co/gmsnCqA0yv#CollinsDictionary#WordoftheYear#Bazballpic.twitter.com/SjaWNYOH4D — Collins Dictionary (@CollinsDict)November 1, 2023 Bazball is a term that came into cricket’s lexicon after England’s Test cricket fortunes swung under coach McCullum, the former New Zealand captain who was known for his aggressive style. Under Stokes’ leadership, England have adopted a go-for-win-at-all-costs attitude, and saw great early success with it. It has only been reluctantly used by the proponents of it. “I don’t have any idea what ‘Bazball’ is,” McCullum had told SEN radio in July last year. “It’s not just all crash and burn, if you look at the approach, and that’s why I don’t really like that silly term that people are throwing out there. “Because there’s actually quite a bit of thought that goes into how the guys manufacture their performances and when they put pressure on bowlers and which bowlers they put pressure on.

… [+7341 chars]",New Zealand,"Legendary All Black winger, and Groov Co-founder, Sir John Kirwan speaks at the MFAA Conference at ... [+] International Convention Centre, Sydney on 25/5/2023. Groov is teaming up with New Zealand Rugby as its official wellbeing partner - helping highlight mental health on and off the field. With the All Blacks looking to lift a fourth Rugby World Cup by the end of October, there is no better moment for the two organizations to raise awareness about a proactive approach to mental wellbeing and mental health issues such as stress, anxiety and depression. With Groov’s platform, rugby unions in New Zealand and offices around the world are being given the tools to help their workers feel good, function better and maintain happy and healthy lifestyles. Groov was co-founded by technology entrepreneur Adam Clark and former All Black winger Sir John Kirwan. Kirwan had a stellar career, winning the World Cup on home soil in 1987 and playing abroad in Italy and Japan in the 80s and 90s. However, throughout his glittering career Kirwan suffered from depression. He sought help and became one of the first major athletes to speak out about mental health and advocate for more training and understanding on the topic. He was even knighted for his rugby exploits and his mental health advocacy work. His company now provides preventative, evidence-based mental wellbeing software for businesses and sports organizations around the world. As previously reported in Forbes, a survey from Mental Health America shows that roughly 50 million American adults suffer from at least one form of mental illness. That same survey reports that nearly 12 million American adults have serious thoughts of suicide. Globally, estimates show that 1 in 4 adults suffer from mental health conditions and according to the United Nations, cases of anxiety and depression are up 25%-27% post-pandemic. As suicide prevention month comes to a close in the U.S. it is worth highlighting the efforts of companies like Groov that provide preventative, proactive tools that help people live happier, healthier lives. Perhaps the most notable thing about Groov’s approach to mental wellbeing is that it recognizes one size does not fit all. The company - which is “dedicated to lifting the mental wellbeing of 100 million people in workplaces all around the globe” - uses clinically-backed and evidence-based data based on over 200 years of combined experience from its clinical team and advisory group. The approach is focused on small, sustainable actions that individuals can use to function and perform better over time. Groov is not a crisis service, it aims to make sure as few people as possible find themselves in need of crisis services. Groov meets people where they are at, and because most people spend the majority of their day at work, Groov meets them in the workplace. The mental wellbeing platform can be directly integrated into whatever platform a business uses - Google, MS Teams, Slack, etc - and uses “bite-sized nudges, notifications and health checks” to regularly prompt workers and executives to take mental breaks and check-in on one another. The platform also takes the pressure off of managers and executives, who Groov CEO Matt Krogstad says are at the highest risk for burnout. The platform checks-in on employees, and they can decide if they want that data to be shared with their manager. Groov also provides training for managers on how to speak to employees and encourage them to do what is best for their mental wellbeing. This lifts their people and their team’s performance. Krogstad notes that mental health issues are pervasive throughout society and will require a variety of solutions. He believes working directly with employers is a great way to tackle mental health, insisting that the platform can help managers understand if their employees are feeling down and who is feeling burnt out. Ultimately, Krogstad believes if employees are feeling good, they - and the business - will perform better. As he puts it, “it's a really compelling business case.” The company’s flagship product is “Groov Anywhere,” which is designed for wired employees. Using the platform while at work and the companion app when at home, people have personalized mental health check-in reminders that encourage them to recharge, relax, focus and enjoy. A happy, focused workforce is more productive, innovative, creative and engaged. The company also combines the app with live events, to help tackle really tough issues and reach unwired workers. Like the software, the live events are integrated into the flow of the workplace and are co-hosted with executives from the employer. Groov has become New Zealand Rugby's official wellbeing partner, growing its presence beyond the ... [+] office. Krogstad notes that feedback about the platform has been positive and that families and kids of employees who use Groov have also found it beneficial. He says, kids particularly enjoy the breathing exercises the mobile app offers. The seamless integration into the workplace and home allows a proactive approach to wellbeing to become almost second nature, with the idea being that people will naturally feel and function better by taking small daily steps. Groov uses six pillars of evidence-based small daily actions that are designed to provide positive feedback loops: 1. Chill 2. Do 3. Connect 4. Move 5. Celebrate 6. Enjoy. By partnering with New Zealand Rugby, Groov is taking its performance platform to the next level. It is hard to play down the influence sports have in communities around the world, and in New Zealand, rugby is king. The two organizations will benefit from mutual collaboration, putting mental performance at the forefront in business and in sports. As Krogstad says, “they [New Zealand Rugby] are an organization that has shown high performance in sports and have uniquely focused on mental performance.” The All Blacks have become known for their performances under pressure, overcoming the chokers tag that weighed them down for nearly two decades. Pressure has become a privilege in their environment and this mindset has helped increase enjoyment and decrease anxiety within the team. As the Rugby World Cup winds down and suicide prevention month ends in the U.S. it is important to remember that mental health is just as important as physical health. Everyday there are people suffering with invisible challenges, and without proper education, care and support they could head down a dark road. The pressure of sports and the pressure of life can often build into anxiety, depression and unmanageable stress, which is why it is critical that everyday people are afforded the opportunity to care for themselves. Groov is providing this platform for millions of workers around the world, and is helping create a happier and healthier workplace and society. Their everyday mental wellbeing model is about more than just helping people manage stress and pressure, it is about protecting from future mental risk and improving people’s daily life experience. Together with New Zealand Rugby, Groov is showing that people and athletes can overcome adversity and thrive if mental health and wellbeing are given the attention they deserve. This means being open and honest about when a break is needed, discussing issues such as anxiety and depression and seeking help before things get worse. With this in mind, life can be celebrated and enjoyed at work and at home."

[+] discovered by geologists. Utrecht University PhD candidate Suzanna van de Lagemaat has reconstructed a massive and previously unknown tectonic plate that was once one-quarter the size of the Pacific Ocean. She reconstructed the lost plate through computer simulations and field research in the mountain belts of Japan, New Zealand, New Guinea, Borneo and the Philippines. Earth's rigid outer shell is divided into a dozen large tectonic plates and microplates, but their number varied over geological time. Tectonic plates consisting mostly of heavy oceanic crust have disappeared into the Earth's mantle by means of subduction. Only fragments thrusted into mountain belts survived this process. ""The Philippines is located at a complex junction of different plate systems. The region almost entirely consists of oceanic crust, but some pieces are raised above sea level, and show rocks of very different ages,"" explained de Lagemaat. Van de Lagemaat first reconstructed the movements of the current plates in the region between Japan and New Zealand over the past 150 million years. The reconstruction showed a gap opening between the Australian Plate in the south, the Eurasian Plate in the north, the Indian Plate in the west and the Pacific Plate in the east. So she started to look for tangible evidence of a missing plate fitting this gap. ""We also conducted field work on northern Borneo, where we found the most important piece of the puzzle. We thought we were dealing with relicts of a lost plate that we already knew about. But our magnetic lab research on those rocks indicated that our finds were originally from much farther north, and had to be remnants of a different, previously unknown plate."" Tectonic plates sink only slowly into Earth's mantle. The Farallon Plate, part of the Pacific Ocean subducted over 30 million years ago beneath the North American continent, is still visible in seismic surveys. Geologists already assumed that a now vanished plate existed in the western Pacific region, named Pontus after the Greek deity of the sea, but they weren't sure where. ""Eleven years ago, we thought that the remnants of Pontus might lie in northern Japan, but we'd since refuted that theory,"" said Douwe van Hinsbergen, Van de Lagemaat's Ph.D. supervisor. ""It was only after Suzanna had systematically reconstructed half of the Ring of Fire mountain belts from Japan, through New Guinea, to New Zealand that the proposed Pontus plate revealed itself, and it included the rocks we studied on Borneo."" The relics of Pontus are not only located on northern Borneo, but also on Palawan, an island in the Western Philippines, and in the South China Sea. Together with the position of former tectonic borders, this discovery allowed to reconstruct the full extent of the Pontus Plate. About 150 million years ago it was at least one-quarter the size of the modern Pacific Ocean. As the expanding paleo-Pacific pushed westwards, the Pontus Plate was eventually subducted beneath the Eurasian Plate. Fragments of the seafloor were thrusted onto land and incorporated in the rising mountains as the plates were squeezed together, where they were eventually discovered by de Lagemaat. The geological history of the Pontus oceanic plate as reconstructed by Suzanna van de Lagemaat. This video animation shows the entire geological history of the Pontus oceanic plate as reconstructed by Suzanna van de Lagemaat: The study ""Plate tectonic cross-roads: Reconstructing the Panthalassa-Neotethys Junction Region from Philippine Sea Plate and Australasian oceans and orogens"" was published in the journal Gondwana Research (2023).

He will be under the constant supervision of the BCCI Medical Team. “He will not be taking the flight to Dharamsala with the team on 20th October,” the statement said, adding that Pandya is expected to join back with the team for their match against defending champions England on October 29 in the northern city of Lucknow. Pandya’s Importance Pandya’s absence will be a huge blow to India, who are currently second in the points table behind New Zealand only owing to the net run rate (NRR). So far, Pandya has picked up five wickets in four matches for India, having bowled a total of 16 overs.

There is no like-for-like replacement for Pandya available in the squad. However, the 2011 champions could tweak their combination against the Kiwis and perhaps bring in Suryakumar Yadav for Pandya and Mohammed Shami for Shardul Thakur, ESPNCricinfo website reported.

It is not as viciously spat out, or unimaginatively uttered, or unoriginal as ‘choke’. You can try your hand at solving our Cricket World Cupcrossword But it arches over the entirety of their bat and ball 50 over World Cup history. The word is ‘chase’, and the two sides meeting inPuneon Wednesday uniquely mirror each other, with New Zealand a few paces ahead of the South Africans in how the chase race has panned out. South Africans botched their modest run-chase against Netherlands a few days back. They stuttered against the mighty Australians famously in 1999, and stumbled forgettably against minnows Bangladesh in 2007. So the defeat to the Dutch in the middle of some serious run-loots and 400-plus scores, evoked a wry shake of the head as if to say, “That’s just them.” Poor run chases look like anomalies in most of their World Cup campaigns, until suddenly they are the coup de grace. 1992 to Duckworth & Lewis and England, 1996 to West Indies, 1999 to Australia, 2003 to Sri Lanka and 2011 to New Zealand. But excitingly for this edition, the Proteas arrived in Pune to face their sweet-smiling nemesis New Zealand who tripped them up in both 2011 and 2015 Knockouts, on the back of a 1-wicket thrilling chase against Pakistan inChennai. Keshav Maharaj’s roar alongside Tabraiz Shamsi’s dogged defense, set alight this World Cup edition. It was merely a league match against a Pakistan in shambles, and ought to never have been a desperate last-wicket scramble. Still, the roar showed what going past the line meant to the Saffers. The country’s most shocking loss when chasing against New Zealand in World Cups came in 2011, when Daniel Vettori exerted a spin-strangle on a wicked Dhaka wicket to squeeze the batting life out of a vaunted SA top 6 of Amla, Smith, Kallis, AB deVilliers, Duminy and Faf, and Jacob Oram landed the knockout punches with 4 wickets. Follow all the action from theCricket World Cup 2023on our special World Cup section. You can also find the lateststats, like thetop scorerand thehighest wicket-takerof the current edition, upcomingWorld Cup fixturesand thepoints tableon the site. It was Jacques Kallis’ most unfluent 75 deliveries faced. And though it pales in memory to the Donald harakiri of 1999, a mixup runout that claimedAB de Villiers, ended hopes of one of the strongest Cup teams SA ever fielded. New Zealand are haunted by no such Halloweens of cricket batting. Against South Africa in World Cups alone, where they have won 6 of their 8 faceoffs since 1992, 5 have been successful run-chases. Things got tight in the 2015 Auckland semifinals, when they won by 4 wickets, off the penultimate ball. The victory margin was ditto in a group game of 2019 though this time, the Kiwis won with 3 balls remaining, steered by a calmKane Williamsonton despiteChris Morristriggering collapses at 4/80 and 5/137 while chasing 242. They even tied a Super Over target of 15 last time and were thrown a technicality to deny them the World Cup.Jimmy Neeshamwas back to doing his thing last week, bringing them within 5 runs of a mammoth target of 388 at Dharamshala against Australia. Captain Tom Latham, whose father Rod made 60 the first time that the Kiwis slashed down the Saffer target in 1992, speaking on match-eve, gave an insight into just how little these narrow losses sting a team like New Zealand not racked by chasing nightmares. “It was fantastic how our batters put us in a position to win a game chasing almost 400. We were just one shot away from winning so we’ll put these learnings into tomorrow’s game” he would say. Latham said the team had recognized fairly early on that it was a good pitch, and set about in pursuit of 389. “We’ll look at the positives.” What New Zealand chase, not unlike South Africa, is their first World Cup trophy in cricket. The Proteas misses and their eluding success in World Cups has evoked everything from lilting laments to bawling ballads. New Zealand came closer than the Saffers, and were dealt brutal blows especially Martin Crowe’s men in 1992 andBrendon McCullum’s crew in 2015. The 2019 finish will struggle to summon a coherent closure. Yet, New Zealand plod on, without dramatics or poetry, without riffing off Greek tragedies. There are other semifinals misses too, that don’t even make the litany of heartbreaking losses though it would’ve equally hurt the personnel. They just get up after every loss, dust themselves off, and turn up at the next edition. Latham, a second-generation World Cup chaser, took over the baton from not just his father, but stepping in as captain carries the same optimism that renders the Australia loss to a pointer in lessons learnt. Kane Williamson who batted for 30-odd deliveries outside the NZ nets in Pune, has perfected the comeback — be it from ridiculous World Cup rules or a busted knee or a freakish thumb injury, which he described as “turning fat and colourful very fast after it was struck.” Kiwi cricket wears its heartbreaks and bone-shatters lightly. Destiny’s reward New Zealand chase destiny’s reward for the years of consistency and excellence in their cricket. Unlike South Africa whose outstanding talents like Hansie Cronje, Allan Donald, Lance Klusener, Kallis, AB deVilliers,Dale Steyn, Faf Du Plessis and Graeme Smith were burdened with pressure of winning the World Cups and perhaps caved under it, New Zealand have always been an unassuming unit without celebrity or stardom. Like Rod Latham who was support cast to Greatbatch in 1992, a dozen others have contributed to their win record against Saffers in World Cups — SA haven’t won since 1999. While Stephen Fleming and Williamson have captain’s tons in run chases, the heroes are as varied as Nathan Astle who went after Donald in 2003, Craig McMillan who took out the middle order in 2007 and chased calmly, Jacob Oram in 2011, Corey Anderson and Grant Elliot in 2015 and Colin de Grandhomme whose 60 off 47 got them the last 100 in 2019. In this, they live the All Blacks mantra of shared responsibility. Latham spoke of All Blacks highlighting NZ’s racial diversity as much as Springboks did theirs at the Rugby World Cup. But from that losing ABs final on Saturday, the Black Caps gleaned out their lessons. “It was unfortunate to end on the wrong side, but they taught us to scrap all the way to the end, fight hard till deep in the back end of the game,” he said. Perhaps because the two are so similar in the brand of cricket they play, knowing they’ll always be in the shadow of adored rugby teams until they nail down a World Cup of their own, their matches have been so even. There’s rarely an edge to their rivalry, plentiful of mutual respect, and maybe a shared annoyance of Australia, boisterous with its five World Cups."

It is a colour that means dominance in these parts. In the not-so-distant past, there was even a period when one could be denied entry at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on match days for donning black shirts or t-shirts. But on Friday, as the rest of the world’s gaze was onAhmedabad, and all the talk centred around India vs Pakistan, it was hard to miss a black t-shirt withKane Williamson’s name on its back. On a humid evening, between their bowlers’ splendid job and Daryl Mitchell’s finishing touch, it was Williamson who weaved his magic with an unbeaten 78 to guide New Zealand to their third successive win at the World Cup. The eight-wicket victory over Bangladesh may have been a resounding one but one could see New Zealand preferring not to make a big deal of it. “Six more matches to go, let’s see how it goes,” was the cliché that their players stuck to later on. Of course, humility is a Kiwi characteristic. But one would never know with these poker-faced men, who have a zillion tricks up their sleeves with bat and ball in hand that allow them to embrace each and every condition they encounter with aplomb.   A post shared by ICC (@icc) Maybe, they prefer it this way, for it helps them fly under the radar before others wake up and realise that they are in the semifinals once again. The way they have got off the blocks at this World Cup in three varied conditions in Ahmedabad,Hyderabadand now inChennaion Friday has all the makings of a team that can go the distance after two near-misses in the last two editions. The original underdogs at every World Cup, perhaps this is the one where they emerge as top dogs on every front. After Lockie Ferguson’s stellar spell in the middle overs, Bangladesh managed to stretch their total to 245. It definitely seemed sub-par on this surface, but not something that looked like a walk in the park for New Zealand. Apart from Williamson, in Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra and Tom Latham they had the ideal nimble-footed batsmen to tackle Bangladesh’s spin threat.   A post shared by ICC (@icc) But after the early dismissal of Ravindra, it once again came down to Williamson. When he limped off the field after attempting a catch during the first match of the IPL all those months ago, the World Cup looked like a near-impossible dream. A ruptured ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) in his right knee, the worst sort of injury an athlete could suffer, needed surgery and a long recovery. Such injuries tend to sideline elite athletes across sports for eight to nine months at least. Williamson even got the World Cup out of his mind as it could have turned him desperate. “It was probably a good thing just to get my head stuck into rehab each day and not sort of rush it and that was really my focus and I was fortunate as well I had a really, really good team around me back home and also fortunate not to have a lot of setbacks during that time,” Williamson said. Calm and focused As the World Cup neared, Williamson – just like how he fronts up in a chase – hardly panicked, letting time do the healing. There were milestones to take care off at each phase of the recovery, similar to what he faced in Chennai in pursuit of the target. Not once did he seem out of place, or do anything that could invite trouble. With Bangladesh asking questions with the new ball, he fought through the tough phase, which would have reminded him of his early days after the injury. It wasn’t the time for the ego to take over. Baby steps had to be taken before he walked briskly. Williamson just grinded it out. The timing, which is the essence of his batting, was at the forefront of it. Not for a single delivery did he look like a batsman who hadn’t played an international fixture for seven months. He first stitched an 80-run partnership for the second wicket with Conway that put New Zealand on the way. And for the third wicket in the company of Mitchell, who in the past has struggled on subcontinent pitches, Williamson milked the Bangladesh attack. With the required run rate well under control and Mitchell showing a tendency to struggle against spinners, he took it upon himself to let his partner settle, even helping him overcome a nervy start.  In the stands, each run that Williamson ran prompted claps. Boundaries would be greeted with cheers. By now, Chepauk was entering the territory where Williamson was beginning to put on an exhibition, but only for it to be cut short by a throw that hit him on the thumb prompting him to retire hurt on 78, after having put together an unbroken 108-run stand with Mitchell. Barring that slight hiccup in the end with regard to Williamson, this was yet another outing where New Zealand pulled the strings from ball one."

 The New Zealand economy is driven by agriculture … [+2899 chars]",New Zealand,"The New Zealand economy is driven by agriculture with around 10 million cattle and 25 million sheep - that's seven times more livestock than people in the country.   Like many in the world, the government in Wellington to tackle climate change and just under half of New Zealand's emissions come from agriculture. As cattle are the main culprits, with their belches and farts containing methane, the plan is to put a price on agricultural emissions --  in effect taxing burps and farts from livestock . Farmers would be taxed according to the size of their land, the amount of livestock they own, their overall production and their use of nitrogen fertiliser. Many farmers fear, however, that the pricing will hurt profits and threaten livelihoods.  How much could the 'burp tax' be? The Irish Examiner cited a calculation  prepared by US Department of Agriculture experts, using a modelling approach of NGO Beef + Lamb New Zealand Ltd. It shows that the 'burp' tax would cost a typical big dairy farm in the country more than €11,000 per year, with methane priced at €0.067 per kg. The calculation includes plenty of incentive discounts on emission reduction actions and technologies, but without those the levy could be as much as €52,000 in a year.  Could the burp tax heavily influence the elections? And this topic may well be an important one to consider in the general elections on Saturday for some 85,000 voters employed in agriculture. ""I think it will impact on how agricultural rural communities vote this election,"" Kate Wyeth, a sheep and beef farmer near the capital Wellington on the North Island, told AFP. ""Particularly whichever party - or group of parties - is looking at giving the agricultural industry time to adapt new technologies that aren't even available to us yet,"" she added. The proposed plan still needs the approval of the parliament before the tax system can take effect in 2025 at the earliest. However, opposition centre-right party National has said it will push it back further to 2030 if elected. Wyeth said that technologies need to be developed -- for example, feeds given to livestock that reduce methane emissions -- to stop farmers feeling that their only choice is to reduce livestock numbers. Could lowering emissions be financially beneficial? ""We are one of the world's leading agricultural countries and agricultural emissions make up half of the total pollution that we put into the atmosphere every year,"" James Shaw, the country's Minister for Climate Change, told AFP. Lowering emissions could benefit New Zealand's farmers by attracting foreign buyers willing to pay more for sustainable agricultural products, Shaw said. ""There is a sweet spot with lower emissions and lower pollution and higher profits for farms,"" he added. The Washington Post cited a government modeling that suggests that sheep and beef revenue would drop by around 20% by 2030 — driving many farms out of business. "

April Lawrie,… [+3721 chars]",New Zealand,"UN Indigenous experts are visiting Australia while a new report warns of the risk of a new stolen generation. An Aboriginal Commissioner has warned that Australia risks another Stolen Generation if the current “devastating rates” of Aboriginal children being removed from their families continue. April Lawrie, the South Australian Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People, found Aboriginal children were increasingly being removed from their families, despite the state government’s commitments to reduce family separation. If current trends continue, the report found that “the number of Aboriginal children living in out-of-home care will increase by a further 50 percent over the next decade”. An inquiry led by Lawrie has already heard from almost 1,000 people, including Aboriginal children, families and elders, as well as people working in child protection and family support services.      According to apreliminary reportreleased on Tuesday, many children shared feelings of “disbelief, sadness and anger” at finding out, sometimes years later, that they were taken away from their homes when “there was one or more members of their family or community who could have brought them up”. Despite a state commitment to ensuring that more children were placed with extended families or within their own communities, Lawrie found that children were often removed without adequate consultation with relevant local Indigenous community organisations, especially in regional areas of the state. “A child’s cultural identity develops through connection to family, community and country,” said Lawrie. “Family and culture is everything” and “disconnection will only continue the cycle of disadvantage, poverty and trauma”. “One out of every two Aboriginal children [in South Australia] were subject to at least one child protection notification in 2020-21, while for non-Aboriginal children, these rates decreased to just one in every 12 children,” the report found. Meanwhile, United Nations experts on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples are currently visiting Western Australia in response to similar concerns there about the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families and communities. The UN experts were invited to Western Australia by the Noongar Family Safety and Wellbeing Council, an Aboriginal-controlled organisation. They will visit the cities of Perth, Albany and Geraldton and are expected to deliver a report when their 10-day visit ends on October 10. TheStolen Generationrefers to a period in Australian history where Aboriginal children were removed from their families at “systemic” levels, according to the commissioner’spreliminary report. It is estimated that between 10 and 33 percent of Aboriginal children were taken from their families in this way between 1910 and 1970. “In 1997, the South Australian Parliament and in 2008 the Australian Parliament apologised to all Aboriginal people for the Stolen Generations,” the commissioner’s report noted. Australians are currently preparing to vote in areferendumon October 14 on whether to change the constitution to include an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice in parliament. According to the most recent2022 Close the Gap Report, the official update on outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, addressing preventable inequalities will require drawing on Indigenous people’s knowledge and expertise. “We know that to improve the outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, large-scale systemic reform and a paradigm shift in policy design and delivery is necessary to truly empower Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,” the report found. Unlike New Zealand, Canada and the United States, Australia does not currently have any treaties with the hundreds of Aboriginal and Torres Strait nations with continuous cultures pre-dating the colonisation of Australia by tens of thousands of years.

But our understanding of the interactions between the Antarctic ocean, sea ice and atmosphere, and their role in the Earth's physical, chemical andbiological processesis incomplete, especially near the coast where glaciers meet the sea ice and ocean,"" Dr. Heil said.""While there have been repeat orlong-term studiesat some Antarctic locations, the region in the far East Antarctic and Ross Sea is largely understudied and poorly observed.""This region connects a number of ice shelves and areas of open water known as 'polynyas,' which promote sea-ice growth and underpin a diverse and rich ecosystem.""Writing inFrontiers in Marine Sciencethis month, the research team proposed a range of observing initiatives based on existing activities, knowledge gaps and future needs.The observing system should include:moored oceanographic instruments to study ocean chemistry and physicsremote sensing technologies on satellites, aircraft, drifting buoys and autonomous underwater vehicles, for sea-ice and ecosystem monitoringautomatic weather stations on land and at seaintegration of observations in models""Once rolled out and refined, RSfEAR will provide the backbone to extend deeper onto the continent and further out to sea, for a full longitudinal Antarctic-Southern Ocean observatory,"" Dr. Heil said.The RSfEAR region of interest spanning between 110°E and 155°W (bold dashed lines) superimposed over sea-ice concentration (September 2022). The continental shelf-break is marked by a dash-dot line. The figure also shows potential locations for key elements of an observing system including hydrographic stations, ecosystem monitoring, nominal biogeochemical (BGC) float coverage, automatic weather stations (AWS), and ocean–sea ice–atmosphere transect information either from vessel or air. (B) Sea ice is highly varied: a mosaic of different sea-ice conditions including (i) sparse pack, (ii) active polynya, (iii) marginal ice zone, (iv) fast ice, (v) platelet underside, and (vi) significant under ice productivity.

Sci. 10:1206119East Antarctic monitoring programThe proposed RSfEAR will complement and extend a new East Antarctic Monitoring Program (EAMP) being developed by the Australian Antarctic Division.EAMP Leader, Dr. Patricia Miloslavich, said the EAMP would provide situational awareness of East Antarctica and the Southern Ocean through long-term scientific observations of essential climate, ocean, and biodiversity variables in the region.""The EAMP will address major unknowns and uncertainties that currently hinder our capacity for forecasting, prediction, management, and attribution of impacts on what is changing and why,"" Dr. Miloslavich said.""It will also facilitate coordination of different research disciplines and better integration of data collection, analysis and reporting.""Improved coverage of observations across Antarctica and across different scientific disciplines will help scientists understand recent extreme events and their trajectory.These events include the lowest winter sea-ice extent on record (since 1979) in September 2023—some 1.75 million square kilometers below the 1981–2010 average maximum extent.In March 2022,surface temperaturesin Antarctica rose by more than 30°C relative to the long-term average, due to an ""atmospheric river"" carrying warm air masses deep into the continent.Later the same year a breakout of near-coastal fast ice (sea ice anchored to the continent or seafloor) led to a near complete breeding failure of emperor penguins in the Bellingshausen Sea.""Given the recent extremes in Antarctic sea-ice extent, as well as record ice-sheet melting, changes in ocean salinity and temperature, and atmospheric changes, a better observational capability will improve our ability to predict future climate change."" Dr. Heil said.""It will also provide a foundation to assess and measure impacts for ecosystems and distant, low-latitude regions."""

But he would no doubt empathize with the challenges faced by today's workers.History tells us that Parnell, recently arrived from London, agreed to take a job building a store on the proviso he only work eight hours a day. Hereportedly toldhis would-be employer, ""There are twenty-four hours per day given us; eight of these should be for work, eight for sleep, and the remaining eight for recreation and in which for men to do what little things they want for themselves.""Given the scarcity of carpenters at the time, there wasn't a lot of bargaining and Parnell was granted his wish. The idea gained momentum, with a meeting of Wellington workmen later that year resolving to work from 8am to 5pm.They also agreed that anyone offending against this principle would be ducked in the harbor—one way of ensuring solidarity perhaps. The principle of an eight-hour day was picked up by various union campaigns, and over timeachieved some recognition in law.More than 180 years after Parnell made his stand, New Zealanders largely take the celebration of Labour Day for granted. But those able to enjoy the coming long weekend might also pause to reflect on what has happened to the eight-hour day in an era of constant digital connection and being ""always on"".Constant connectivityWhen Samuel Parnell left work each day, neither his employer nor or his co-workers could contact him. Before any real rapid communications technology, let alone cell phones or email, he had no reason to contemplate the need for a ""right to disconnect"".But our modern, digital work lives raise serious questions about how we reconcile the demands of work with the need for rest, recreation and family life.

Hereportedly toldhis would-be employer, ""There are twenty-four hours per day given us; eight of these should be for work, eight for sleep, and the remaining eight for recreation and in which for men to do what little things they want for themselves.""Given the scarcity of carpenters at the time, there wasn't a lot of bargaining and Parnell was granted his wish. The idea gained momentum, with a meeting of Wellington workmen later that year resolving to work from 8am to 5pm.They also agreed that anyone offending against this principle would be ducked in the harbor—one way of ensuring solidarity perhaps. The principle of an eight-hour day was picked up by various union campaigns, and over timeachieved some recognition in law.More than 180 years after Parnell made his stand, New Zealanders largely take the celebration of Labour Day for granted.

Follow all the action from theCricket World Cup 2023on our special World Cup section.

The Proteas landed inPune, with that picture of Maharaj roaring after a single-wicket victory over Pakistan freeze-framed in memory. While their batsmen continued piling on misery on opposing bowling crews, scoring a couple of more hundreds batting first and accumulating most sixes by any team in a single World Cup, it was Marco Jansen and Maharaj who ensured New Zealand didn’t even begin to dream of challenging 357, let alone come within 5 runs of a 380-odd score like they did against Australia. New Zealand had won five World Cup chases against South Africa in their history, and hadn’t lost to them on that stage in the 21st century. But it was the indefatigable spinner who bowls back home on unresponsive tracks, and the pace-bowling all-rounder who wasn’t first-choice when the squad got pencilled in, who helped flip that match-up history. Dhaka 2011 and Auckland 2015 can never be undone, but Maharaj, known as a man of serenity and calm in South Africa, put in two nerveless back-to-back performances to ensure Pune 2023 would see the Proteas finally thump the Black Caps.   A post shared by ICC (@icc) The left-arm spinner took 4-46 as South Africa won by 190 runs. New Zealand were left ruing winning the toss and fielding first – right up Proteas’ alley. Introduced into the attack just when the dangerous Daryl Mitchell was threatening to cleave open the chase, and had sent Gerald Coetzee to the boundary three times, Maharaj would strike right away. Luring Mitchell into a big shot, he watched David Miller pouch the first of two tough skiers to claim South Africa’s fifth wicket. Even though Jansen and Coetzee had stabbed at the top order, New Zealand were always dangerous as long as Mitchell was around. It was a battle of the two left-arm tweakers next, when Mitchell Santner rocked back and punched a Maharaj delivery that was a tad short, past mid-off. The smart and smarting Maharaj would float the next one fuller, and it would hold and turn just the right amount as Santner went back in the crease once again but was tricked on the inside edge as the ball crashed into the stumps. “I changed the angle, and bowled into the footmarks,” he would say later. You can try your hand at solving our Cricket World Cupcrossword For his third to claim the eternal fighter in New Zealand chases,Jimmy Neesham, Maharaj flighted it monstrously and dragged it wider to the foot marks left by his pacers. Neesham, who was yet to get off the mark, would stride out to defend, and Maharaj watched gleefully as the ball turned wickedly to pierce the gap between pad and bat to rattle the stumps.   A post shared by ICC (@icc) He would continue to float it toTrent Boultwho stepped out but ended up connecting with the bottom of the bat. Miller, who had sent a few sailing into the glorious Pune sunset during his half-century earlier in the day, would position himself under the dipping ball, shield his eyes against the floodlights and pouch it with palms facing up. Coetzee had earlier sent back Will Young, who looked comfortable in his 33-run stay, but it was Jansen who silenced the crowd that picked up the decibels with ‘Rachin, Rachin, Rachin’ chants, forcing the youngster to hit out in a rush of blood. Understated hero Maharaj, whose orthodox style sees his skill and control being often overlooked, is part of South Africa’s leadership group, and skipper Temba Bavuma is known to rely on his counsel greatly. It meant that despite him racing against time to come back from a knee injury – he was told it might need six months – South Africa were willing to punt on him being even semi-fit so he could play the back end of the tournament. The captain had insisted he wanted Maharaj in the 15 no matter what. The chase against Pakistan inChennaiearned him more respect for the calm manner in which he approached a tense situation, something the South Africans treasure like gold. Never particularly outspoken or boisterous, Maharaj is respected not unlike Quinton de Kock, for his unflappable temperament on the field and cricketing acumen. He’s known to be a devout Hindu, just asHashim Amlawas a Muslim, and brings in the added diversity of culture into the rainbow dressing room. A picture of Lord Hanuman is said to be pasted on his bat, which he worships like a warrior would his weapon. And that was the reason he first kept the bat down like placing down a baby, before going mental with the celebrations in Chennai.   A post shared by ICC (@icc) There wasn’t much aid for spinners on the Pune track, and that’s how South Africa went hard at the Kiwis in the middle overs, culminating in the final acceleration. Glenn Phillips would later admit they couldn’t strangle the South Africans, and had gone by the information they received when choosing to bowl. But Maharaj – that name acquires epic proportions in these parts as that’s how Shivaji was known – would work his magic by ramping up pressure in the duels. Rassie van der Dussen, speaking later, would thank de Kock for staying calm, thinking clearly and asking him to extend the innings deep. “It was tough to play Santner. But we realised we don’t alway have to play in fifth gear. We can start on third and push from there,” he said. He added that de Kock, his favourite batting partner, was never too far from a joke. “At one stage he got a 4, and I was looking away, and he startled me with ‘Rass, Rass, Rass’ and then grinned when I started to take a run.”  The Pune crowd had a dedicated Proteas fan group which came wearing 1999 jerseys with pictures of legends of yore like Jonty Rhodes, Shaun Pollock, Graeme Smith and Lance Klusener, though a bulk of the neutral crowd leaned towards Rachin Ravindra, amongst the ethnic Indians in the two teams. However, as the crowd broke into a dance to the beats of ‘Zingaat’, it was South Africa’s Maharaj who walked away with the final applause."

For professional athletes, representing their country in a global sporting event is usually their driving ambition and winning it is the crowning glory of their careers. For most cricketers, the one-day international (ODI) World Cup is such a tournament, but many top-class players miss out on the quadrennial tournament – often because of injury, but sometimes due to tactical decisions or bust-ups. Here are five top players who are missing out on the2023 ICC Cricket World Cup, hosted by India from October 5 to November 19. Bangladesh’s most prolific batsman in the ODI format and one of their all-time greats was left out when thesquad was announced belatedlylast week. Selectors said the 34-year-old’s persistent back injury forced him out of the final squad as they didn’t want to “take a risk” in the 46-day tournament. The left-handed opener has scored 8,357 runs, including 14 centuries, in 243 ODIs for the South Asian side, but has been in and out of the side over the past few years due to injury. Heannouncedand thenreverseda shock retirement earlier this year. A day after Bangladesh named their squad, the former captain lashed out at the board for “creating barriers” preventing his inclusion. The drama continued as Bangladesh’s captain Shakib Al Hasan called Iqbal’s statements “childish and immature”. Given the controversy, the batter’s injuries and age, it is unlikely that he will be part of Bangladesh’s squad in the 2028 edition of the tournament. Shah has been a key component of Pakistan’s recent bowling attack, ably sharing the responsibility of opening the bowling with Shaheen Shah Afridi. The 20-year-old keeps the batters in check from one end at an impressive economy rate of 4.68 in 14 matches, while Afridi attacks from the other. Shah has also built a reputation for finishing off run chases when he comes in to bat lower down the order – just askAfghanistan. But Pakistan were forced leave Shah out of the World Cup squad after he suffered a major shoulder injury during Pakistan’s Asia Cup match against India last month. He is likely to be out injured for three to four months, according to Pakistan’s selectors. With a heavy heart, I'm sharing that I will not be part of this amazing team that will be representing our beloved country. While I'm disappointed, I believe everything is in Allah's hands. InshahAllah will be on the field very soon. Thank you to all my fans for the prayers! — Naseem Shah (@iNaseemShah)September 22, 2023  It was a roller coaster of emotions for Roy as he was named in England’s provisional World Cup squad, then left out when the defending champions named their final 15. Roy was a vital member of England’s white-ball revolution that began under former captain Eoin Morgan after a dismal run at the 2015 edition, and he was one of their leading run scorers (443 runs in seven matches) when they turned things around to win their first World Cup four years later at Lord’s. The 33-year-old opening batter has not been a permanent fixture in the England side due to injury and missed out on making a case for his inclusion in the World Cup squad as he suffered back spasms during last month’s ODI series against New Zealand. England’s coach Matthew Mott said Roy’s exclusion from the squad was “the toughest decision” he has made and insisted that the batter was happy to be among the reserves for the tournament. Captain Jos Buttler said the “brutal nature of sport” means that good players often miss out on big tournaments. Hasaranga has earned a reputation as Sri Lanka’s biggest cricket star of the past few years. The lethal leg-spinning all-rounder has three five-wicket hauls amongst his 67 wickets in ODI cricket, backed up with four half-centuries in 832 runs. But the all-rounder suffered an injury during the Asia Cup and was not able to fully recover in time for the squad announcement, Sri Lanka Cricket said in a statement. The 26-year-old’s absence will be a major blow to the 1996 champions considering he was the leading wicket-taker in the last two T20 World Cups and has been their most prolific bowler in recent years. Hasaranga will be considered as a replacement player should a member of the travelling squad suffer an injury. New Zealand’s 2022 ODI player of the year will miss the tournament due to an Achilles injury suffered during an English county match in June. The 32-year-old’s absence has dealt a big blow to the 2019 runners-up, who play the World Cup opener on October 5 against defending champions England. Bracewell can bat up and down the order, bowl decent off-spin and is also able to keep wickets. His batting average of 42.5 comes at an impressive strike rate of 118.60 in ODI cricket. New Zealand coach Gary Stead said Bracewell is a “great team man”. “We’ve seen his exceptional skills in all three facets of the game and he was shaping as an important player for us at the World Cup in India.” No Michael Bracewell for the ODI World Cup is a huge blow for New Zealand. For his impact balancing the side from No 7, his explosive hitting at the back end, and how his off spin complements Mitchell Santner's left-arm, he's arguably an even bigger loss than Kane Williamson. — Tim Wigmore (@timwig)June 14, 2023           Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Our discovery of seven geochemically unique volcanicglassshards buried deep within an ice core confirms the likely timing of the eruption in late summer/early autumn in the year 232,"" he said.The volcanic glass shards were found at a depth of 279 meters in the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolutionice core, taken from West Antarctica.Analysis of the geochemical make-up of the shards linked them to the Taupō eruption. Researchers were then able to assess how long the shards had been there based on the modeled age of the ice layers.(A–C) SEM images of rhyolitic volcanic glass shards isolated from RICE ice core sample 11696 (278.822–278.843 m depth). Note the presence of cubic NaCl grains on and adjacent to the Taupō-derived glass shards.

DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-42602-3""Ice cores provide invaluable records of the past. Finding and fingerprintingvolcanic debristrapped in the ice allows us to date when the eruption occurred because we can link it to the modeled age of the ice,"" Mr. Piva said.Of the seven shards, one was a match for volcanic glass produced by the earlier Ōruanui supereruption of the Taupō volcano. Mr. Piva said this glass would have been unearthed when Taupō erupted again in 232 with fragments finding their way to Antarctica.The other six shards had a similar geochemical composition that researchers considered could be confidently linked to the Taupō eruption itself.""Combined, the seven shards provide a unique and undeniable double fingerprint of the Taupō volcano as the source,"" he said.Detecting the glass shards in Antarctica, which is about 5,000 km away from Taupō, shows the power of the eruption.""A massive eruption plume would have sent a huge volume of volcanic particles into the air where they would have been widely dispersed by the wind. Confirming theeruptiondate provides an opportunity to study the volcano's potential global effects on the atmosphere and climate, which is crucial for better understanding its eruptive history and behavior."""

California Gov. Gavin Newsom's recent signing of a law that requires large companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions has refocused attention on the role of business in combatting climate change. In this article, Lily Hsueh, a visiting scholar at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, discusses California's first-of-its-kind law, climate action challenges and opportunities for corporations, and more.Hsueh, an associate professor of economics andpublic policyat Arizona State University's School of Public Affairs, studies corporate environmental behavior and public policy, including its effects on vulnerable communities. She is completing a book that examines governance and economic and political factors that motivate some global businesses but not others to engage in proactive climate action.Does voluntary corporate climate action work, or do we need to mandate climate disclosures from businesses?Hsueh: We know that companies are profit seeking entities, and they actually think a lot about the costs of private and public politics. They will act preemptively if threatened by activism or to get ahead of expected regulation. But how much effort they put towards substantive performance depends on the credibility of the activism and existing regulation or the threat of future regulation. Ultimately, voluntary corporate climate action can work, if it is well designed.For example, companies around the world, including manytechnology companiesbased in Silicon Valley, voluntarily disclose theircarbon managementand emissions to the CDP (formerly called the Carbon Disclosure Project), a nonprofit based in London that surveys companies about their plans to measure, report, and reduce carbon emissions on behalf of institutional investors. However, myresearchshows that since the CDP grades companies based on sustainability outputs rather than outcomes, companies could earn an ""A"" or ""B"" grade from CDP and still increase their entity-wide carbon emissions, notably when they do not experience regulatory pressure.What about the argument that these kinds of reporting requirements are unfair, costly burdens on companies that will hurt the US economy?Hsueh: The type of reporting we are talking about is required only oflarge corporations. Most U.S. companies are small. Just about all large corporations are multinationals. They have been preparing for these mandatory disclosure rules for a while. Currently, more than two-thirds of them voluntarily report to the CDP. The European Union, countries like New Zealand and Singapore, and cities like Hong Kong, as well as the SEC's proposed disclosure rule have built on this system to varying degrees.Large companies operating in California and federal government contractors are now being required to use the same or similar reporting protocol. I would say in many ways it is not cumbersome for the large corporations targeted because most of them have by now participated in voluntary carbon disclosure.Is there a silver lining for companies with California's SB 253 and similar reporting regulations?Since the writing is on the wall, it is better to get ahead of the game in terms of regulatory adherence. If we ever get into a world of carbon pricing, large companies will be better able to quantify their direct and indirect upstream and downstream emissions, and profit from carbon markets. Also, we know a lot of young people care a lot about the environment in ways that previous generations did not. They are demanding corporations be socially and environmentally responsible. Companies that do not will lose out on consumers and qualified employees. Some research even shows that environmentally conscious employees are willing to accept less pay in order to work for environmentally proactive corporations.How might reporting climate data alter corporations' behavior, business plan, and / or goals?With consistency, comparability, and third-party verification, companies will have to make sure their pledges are real and not just a front for greenwashing. They are going to be held accountable. It represents mainstreaming of climate disclosures.Your upcoming book frames climate change as a 'global commons problem.' What do you mean by that and why does it matter?Hsueh: Theconventional wisdomand the dominant view in economics and much ofpolitical scienceand management is thatclimate changeis a collective action problem. So, actors, whether they are corporations or countries, have the incentive to freeride off of others, to let others shoulder the costs and rights of the global commons. For many years, the conventional solution has been to try to get all the nation states in the world to cooperate. And then the idea is that eventually it will trickle down to the sub-national level, to cities and even to corporations through policies and laws. This approach continues to be relevant. At the same time, there is increasing attention to a more bottom-up approach, involving businesses.Global businesses represent close to 70% of annual global industrialgreenhouse gas emissions, and a majority of thecarbon emissionsare emitted by about 100 corporations. So, these companies' sheer size, economic contribution, and carbon footprint warrant a need to investigate the factors that motivate their climate mitigation or lack thereof, as they respond to different sources of pressures domestically and globally. I examine this in my upcoming book.In the US, some have opposed mandatory emissions reporting and attacked environmental, social, and governance or ESG investing, characterizing it as prioritizing liberal goals over investor returns. What does your research suggest?Hsueh: There's been a lot of myths, misinformation and disinformation about ESG. A well-designed climate disclosure program can help companies by giving clear guidelines of what constitutes a low-carbon initiative, defining carbon footprints so that metrics are comparable across companies and over time, and reporting explicit timelines for phasing out fossil fuel assets set by companies themselves if and when a company pledges to do so.What are some corporate climate policy options that might be feasible in Congress?Hsueh: Increasingly, large numbers of companies are setting an internal price on carbon, and they're doing so voluntarily. So, they are more and more ready for some form of carbon tax, in case that is ever on the horizon. That said, there has to be a policy package, if you will, a portfolio where you include policies with more teeth and more concentrated costs with those with concentrated benefits.Such policy packages would compensate those that bear the costs—for example, through revenue recycling to consumers to offset pricing costs—which could help reduce opposition from potential policy losers. Alternatively, a policy package could invest revenues collected from a carbon pricing scheme toward renewable energy deployment. An increasing number of companies would likely support this policy portfolio approach.Provided byStanford UniversityCitation:

For many years, the conventional solution has been to try to get all the nation states in the world to cooperate. And then the idea is that eventually it will trickle down to the sub-national level, to cities and even to corporations through policies and laws. This approach continues to be relevant. At the same time, there is increasing attention to a more bottom-up approach, involving businesses.Global businesses represent close to 70% of annual global industrialgreenhouse gas emissions, and a majority of thecarbon emissionsare emitted by about 100 corporations. So, these companies' sheer size, economic contribution, and carbon footprint warrant a need to investigate the factors that motivate their climate mitigation or lack thereof, as they respond to different sources of pressures domestically and globally. I examine this in my upcoming book.In the US, some have opposed mandatory emissions reporting and attacked environmental, social, and governance or ESG investing, characterizing it as prioritizing liberal goals over investor returns. What does your research suggest?Hsueh: There's been a lot of myths, misinformation and disinformation about ESG. A well-designed climate disclosure program can help companies by giving clear guidelines of what constitutes a low-carbon initiative, defining carbon footprints so that metrics are comparable across companies and over time, and reporting explicit timelines for phasing out fossil fuel assets set by companies themselves if and when a company pledges to do so.What are some corporate climate policy options that might be feasible in Congress?Hsueh: Increasingly, large numbers of companies are setting an internal price on carbon, and they're doing so voluntarily. So, they are more and more ready for some form of carbon tax, in case that is ever on the horizon. That said, there has to be a policy package, if you will, a portfolio where you include policies with more teeth and more concentrated costs with those with concentrated benefits.Such policy packages would compensate those that bear the costs—for example, through revenue recycling to consumers to offset pricing costs—which could help reduce opposition from potential policy losers. Alternatively, a policy package could invest revenues collected from a carbon pricing scheme toward renewable energy deployment. An increasing number of companies would likely support this policy portfolio approach.Provided byStanford UniversityCitation:

For example, companies around the world, including manytechnology companiesbased in Silicon Valley, voluntarily disclose theircarbon managementand emissions to the CDP (formerly called the Carbon Disclosure Project), a nonprofit based in London that surveys companies about their plans to measure, report, and reduce carbon emissions on behalf of institutional investors. However, myresearchshows that since the CDP grades companies based on sustainability outputs rather than outcomes, companies could earn an ""A"" or ""B"" grade from CDP and still increase their entity-wide carbon emissions, notably when they do not experience regulatory pressure.What about the argument that these kinds of reporting requirements are unfair, costly burdens on companies that will hurt the US economy?Hsueh: The type of reporting we are talking about is required only oflarge corporations. Most U.S. companies are small. Just about all large corporations are multinationals. They have been preparing for these mandatory disclosure rules for a while. Currently, more than two-thirds of them voluntarily report to the CDP. The European Union, countries like New Zealand and Singapore, and cities like Hong Kong, as well as the SEC's proposed disclosure rule have built on this system to varying degrees.Large companies operating in California and federal government contractors are now being required to use the same or similar reporting protocol. I would say in many ways it is not cumbersome for the large corporations targeted because most of them have by now participated in voluntary carbon disclosure.Is there a silver lining for companies with California's SB 253 and similar reporting regulations?Since the writing is on the wall, it is better to get ahead of the game in terms of regulatory adherence. If we ever get into a world of carbon pricing, large companies will be better able to quantify their direct and indirect upstream and downstream emissions, and profit from carbon markets. Also, we know a lot of young people care a lot about the environment in ways that previous generations did not. They are demanding corporations be socially and environmentally responsible. Companies that do not will lose out on consumers and qualified employees. Some research even shows that environmentally conscious employees are willing to accept less pay in order to work for environmentally proactive corporations.How might reporting climate data alter corporations' behavior, business plan, and / or goals?With consistency, comparability, and third-party verification, companies will have to make sure their pledges are real and not just a front for greenwashing. They are going to be held accountable. It represents mainstreaming of climate disclosures.Your upcoming book frames climate change as a 'global commons problem.'

The Gen4 Seated was piloted in cities earlier this year and it is now available in San Francisco and Chicago with further launches in other North American cities and in Australia and New Zealand due soon. The new vehicle, which is accessed like other vehicles in Lime’s fleets through its app, is built on the existing basis of the Gen4 e-scooter. Lime’s new iteration will make micromobility more ""approachable"", Lime president Joe Kraus said. ""The new design allows for added comfort and, when paired with our new storage compartment, will provide for more use cases, encouraging more people to consider Lime to fit their needs."" According to market research by Lime, internal storage is a ""key factor"" in someone choosing a micromobility rental vehicle, something which is typically not part of a traditional e-scooter, which requires the user to stand. The US company said that the vehicle also appeals to older users and users with limited mobility that may have been excluded from other e-scooters or e-bikes given their physical requirements to operate. ""Through our initial launches, we’ve seen how the Gen4 Seated introduces new riders who may have previously been skeptical about e-scooters or e-bikes,"" Josh Meltzer, head of government affairs at Lime, said. ""It reinforces the idea that while the need for affordable and sustainable transportation is universal, sometimes riders just want options that accommodate different needs and preferences. Transitioning more people from cars onto shared electric vehicles ultimately helps cities become healthier, safer, and more livable, and we’re glad the Gen4 Seated will contribute to that goal."" The Gen4 Seated has larger wheels and a lower baseboard to optimize its center of gravity, which the company says increases its safety. It is powered by a swappable battery. Lime recently disclosed that it had $250 million in gross bookings on its vehicles for first half of the year, up 45% year on year, with adjusted EBITDA of $27 million. The company is tipped to be pursuing a public listing soon."

This fall, cruise lines are preparing for a big boost to their offerings and route maps. If you’re planning travel for 2024, these cruise lines have new options just for you. Now that the pandemic is in the rearview mirror, cruise companies are launching new ships, new itineraries and new amenities. Norwegian brings back Asian itineraries with 4 ships in the region Norwegian Jewel returns to Asia after three-year hiatus. Norwegian Cruise Line will bring Norwegian Jewel back to Asia for a six-month period of sailings to 16 itineraries. This is the first time Norwegian will sail in the reason after three years. The ship will visit 11 countries using nine different departure ports on sailings of 10 to 14 days. Starting next year, the cruise line will base four ships in the region including Norwegian Sun’s debut in Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific. Explora Journeys holds naming ceremony for first ship Explora I has naming ceremony in New York City. In New York, Explora I held its naming ceremony and launched its first voyage as the luxury arm of MSC Cruises. Godmother Dr. Sylvia Earle, a famous marine biologist, presided over the ceremony. This is the first of six ships for the brand, and this ship has been sailing since July in Europe before crossing the Atlantic for its naming celebration. It will remain in North America, including Hawaii and the Caribbean, until it returns to Europe next summer. This comes at the same time that the line is celebrating the “float out” of Explora II and the steel cutting of Explora III. Sea Cloud adds special guests to sailings Sea Cloud Spirit has specialty guests on its 2024 sailings. South Florida’s Ortanique Chef Cindy Hutson of Coral Gables will join a February sailing while New York Times best-selling author Les Standiford will be a part of a March Caribbean trip. Both will bring their unique perspective to the trip as guests have the chance to hear about their experiences and chat with them throughout the sailing. These types of specialty sailings draw travelers interested in those areas and give them unprecedented access to leaders in the field. Two new ships join Uniworld fleet Two new ships join the Uniworld fleet Coming from Seaside Collection, these two new ships will join the fleet to sail in Europe starting next year. The three-year, “bareboat” charter agreement involves converting the ships to the Uniworld experience. Previously, the ships operated as Crystal Cruises’ Crystal Bach and Crystal Mahler. With Uniworld, they will be renamed S.S. Victoria and S.S. Elisabeth and sail in the Netherlands and along the Rhine River. Emerald Cruises grows route map in the Med and beyond Emerald Cruises is adding new destinations. The pair of luxury yachts belonging to Emerald Cruises will visit new ports in the coming years thanks to an expansion of its destination list. The popular luxury cruise brand will add the Seychelles aboard Emerald Azzurra and Emerald Sakara as well as new stops in the Mediterranean including stops on the Italian and French rivieras plus visits to the Algarve region of Portugal and more of Croatia’s popular coastline. Virgin Voyages adds new itineraries Reslient Lady will sail the Mediterranean this coming year. The cruise line is adding 27 new sailing routes with more European destinations and a return to Australia and the South Pacific. While the cruise line is delaying the launch of Brilliant Lady, its newest ship, due to “supply chain issues,” it is adding more ports to its existing fleet itinerary. Popular destinations like Santorini, Mykonos and Barcelona remain, but the line is adding new ports like Adelaide, Newcastle, Mooloolaba, Port Douglas, Brisbane and Kangaroo Island in Australia. MSC partners with Miami Dolphins, invests in Miami MSC Cruises is the newest sponsor of the Miami Dolphins. MSC Cruises is launching a new partnership with the Miami Dolphins. The advertising deal will cover Hard Rock Stadium. This year, MSC is boasting its largest presence of ships and itineraries ever in the Americas. The cruise company is also hard at work building the biggest cruise terminal in North American to open in 2024. This will be just in time for the inaugural season of new ship MSC World America’s launch."

South Africa crushed France’s hopes of a maiden World Cup title after withstanding a Paris storm to emerge 29-28 winners of a furious and vintage quarterfinal. In a contest for the ages on Sunday, a scintillating first half ended in a brutal street fight and the Springboks’ experience made the difference against a French team playing their first knockout game since coach Fabien Galthie took over four years ago. The defending champions dug deeper than normal for one of their most resilient performances to knock the highly rated French out of their home World Cup in front of nearly 80,000 fans at Stade de France. “For all the support we’ve had, it’s heartbreaking,” France flanker Charles Ollivon said. Sport.#RWC2023|#FRAvRSApic.twitter.com/YjGzZ0JfRd — Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup)October 15, 2023  France played all the attacking rugby for the first hour, and the crowd loved it, leaving South Africa to feed off crumbs and cling on before suddenly swinging the momentum in the final 13 minutes when lock Eben Etzebeth made up for an earlier yellow card by barging over near the posts. That put South Africa ahead for the first time since a breathless, six-try opening 30 minutes. While France came within a point of the Springboks at the end, their great hopes of a first title, and clinching it at home, slipped away when replacement prop Reda Wardi lost possession in a last, desperate attack after the clock ticked past 80 minutes. The French were stunned, none more than brilliant scrum half and captain Antoine Dupont, who made it back from a broken cheekbone in the pool stage to lead his country. His return was meant to be triumphant, but at the end, the world’s best player slipped down on one knee and tossed his protective scrum cap on the grass in despair. “That will make us learn. But today, it’s hard to take,” Dupont said. Second-ranked France had a two-year, 18-test winning streak at home and were the highest-ranked team left in the tournament, but the French are still without a title and this failure will perhaps hurt more than any of the others, even the lost finals on foreign soil in 1987, 1999 and 2011. “We’re going to try to find something positive by saying that we have a lot of young players, a fine generation,” France flyhalf Matthieu Jalibert said. “But the reality is that today we failed to get out of the quarterfinals of a home World Cup. That’s going to be hard to accept.” Both teams scored three tries in that scintillating start. France’s were all the result of its magnificent attack. The Springboks’ three all came against the run of play. France appeared world-class in those opening minutes and every inch the new favourites for the title after top-ranked Ireland’s exit to three-time champions New Zealand on Saturday, and South Africa looked a little shell-shocked. “We scrambled a lot, especially when we were short of numbers,” Springboks captain Siya Kolisi said. “We talk about chasing lost causes as a group, we don’t give up until they put the ball down over the try line. “If we hadn’t done that, we would be going home tomorrow. We never give up.” The Springboks will face England in the second semifinal on Saturday after New Zealand play Argentina in the first on Friday. England overcame Fiji 30-24 in a tense and nervy win in the earlier quarterfinal.          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

He said if The Men in Green have to beat the big sides they cannot collapse like they did in the high-octane clash. “When you want to beat the best sides in the world are in this tournament. You have to bring your A-game. So I got a boxing match. You can’t have a bad round. You can have a bad blow here and there. But it can’t be consecutive with lots of wickets or clusters of wickets,” Said Morgan speaking to Sky Sports. At the 30th over-mark, Pakistan was looking in a decent position at 155-2.Mohammed Sirajwho was having an average day with the ball cleans skipper Babar Azam after which the entire batting collapsed like ninepins. The neighbours lost eight wickets for 36 runs which would take them to a mediocre score of 191 and India later would chase it down comfortably courtesy ofRohit Sharma’s blistering 86. Morgan also refereed to defending champions England’s opening game where they were thrashed by New Zealand and had a similar problem of losing wickets in clusters. “And we did see it in the first game here in New Zealand against England, where England was starting to get away and throwing the odd punch here and there but couldn’t quite land up blow, which is a substantial partnership that would take them up to a winning par score. I think Pakistan made those mistakes today,” Morgan would say."

The international football body FIFA has announced that the 2030 football World Cup will be hosted byMorocco, Portugal, and Spain,with the first three matches held in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay to mark the 100-year anniversary of the tournament. The decision, announced on Wednesday, means the World Cup will be held in six different countries across three continents. “The FIFA Council unanimously agreed that the sole candidacy will be the combined bid of Morocco, Portugal, and Spain, which will host the event in 2030 and qualify automatically from the existing slot allocation,” FIFA said in a statement. “Additionally, having taken into account the historical context of the first-ever FIFA World Cup, the FIFA Council further unanimously agreed to host a unique centenary celebration ceremony in the country’s capital, Montevideo … as well as three World Cup matches inUruguay, Argentina and Paraguayrespectively.” Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has announced its intention to bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup, state news agency SPA reported on Wednesday. The bid “intends to deliver a world-class tournament and will draw inspiration from Saudi Arabia’s ongoing social and economic transformation and the country’s deep-rooted passion for football,” said a statement from the Saudi Arabian football federation. FIFA said bids for the 2034 World Cup would be limited to Asia and Oceania, because of Wednesday’s decision and the2026 tournamentallocated to the Canada, Mexico and the United States – the first to include men’s teams from 48 different countries. Apart from Saudi Arabia, the other likely contender is Australia which jointly hosted this year’s women’s World Cup with New Zealand. 📷FIFA Council takes key decisions on FIFA World Cup™ editions in 2030 and 2034: Morocco, Portugal and Spain joint bid is the sole candidate to host FIFA World Cup 2030™➡️https://t.co/cKJec1tIE4pic.twitter.com/mwLRerCIlg — FIFA Media (@fifamedia)October 4, 2023  Meant to pay homage to the inaugural World Cup, hosted and won by the South American nation of Uruguay in 1930, the decision may be viewed as excessively complex – it will involve large amounts of travel between different continents and time zones. The agreement was reached on Wednesday between the sport’s continental leaders. “The centennial World Cup could not be far from South America, where everything began,” said Alejandro Dominguez, the president of South American football organisation CONMEBOL. “The 2030 World Cup will be played in three continents.” Morocco is the second African country to host a World Cup, following the 2010 edition in South Africa. Argentina hosted the 1978 tournament and Spain the 1982 edition. Portugal and Paraguay will host World Cup games for the first time like Morocco, but all three have staged continental championships in the past. The tournament will take place in June and July of 2030, with104 matchesscheduled. The most recent Men’s World Cup was hosted by the Middle Eastern nation ofQatarin 2022, culminating in aspellbinding finalbetween France and Argentina, with Argentina emerging victorious.

Afghanistan produced the first shock of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 when they beat defending champions England by 69 runs on Sunday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi. Holders England crumbled for 215 runs in front of Afghanistan’s trio of spinners after winning the toss and asking Afghanistan to bat first. The underdogs set England a target of 285 runs, thanks to a blistering knock of 80 runs off 57 balls from opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz and a half-century from wicketkeeper Ikram Alikhil. Gurbaz brought up his fifty rapidly, but they lost wickets as leg-spinner Adil Rashid (3-42) dismissed Zadran and had Rahmat Shah stumped in his next over. Gurbaz looked well set for a World Cup century having smashed eight fours and four sixes, but the 21-year-old was run out by substitute David Willey at midwicket when skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi called him for a risky run. Gurbaz was livid as he trudged off, smashing his bat on the boundary rope on his way back to the pavilion. Spinners Rashid Khan (23) and Mujeeb Ur Rahman (28) contributed in a lower-order flourish that saw Afghanistan put up a competitive total and allow their bowlers to go all-out against the England batters. Boasting a powerful batting lineup, England were handed an early loss when left-arm pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi dismissed opener Jonny Bairstow in the second over. From then on, Afghanistan’s spinners took over as off spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman bowled out Joe Root for 11 runs and Mohammad Nabi dismissed Dawid Malan for 32. England captain Jos Buttler was dimissed for nine runs by pace bowler Naveen-ul-Haq. Star leg spinner Rashid Khan added to England’s woes by dismissing Liam Livingstone and Adil Rashid. An all-round team effort 🙌Super proud of the performance today 🇦🇫💙#CWC23#ENGvAFGpic.twitter.com/hjENlFmfvl — Rashid Khan (@rashidkhan_19)October 15, 2023  Harry Brook put up a resistance with his 66-run innings, but fell to Mujeeb Ur Rahman in the 35th over to send England reeling at 169-8. Mujeeb he picked up the player of the match award. “Very proud moment to be here in the World Cup and beating the champions, it’s a great achievement for the whole region. I’m so happy with this performance,” Mujeeb said. “As spinners it’s hard to bowl in the powerplay, but I’ve been working in the nets to be as consistent as possible… We knew dew would be a factor.” Rashid said he hoped the victory would put a smile on the faces of people back in Afghanistan, where multiple earthquakes have killed around 1,000 and injured over 2,000. England lost the tournament’s opening match against New Zealand by nine wickets, but beat Bangladesh by 137 runs. Their captain Buttler said it was “a tough loss to take” but congratulated Afghanistan. “They outplayed us today. We were not at the level we wanted to be with the ball and the bat,” Buttler said. “Afghanistan have a really skilful attack… They put us under a lot of pressure.” England are fifth in the group standings with one win from three matches, one place ahead of Afghanistan. Afghanistan suffered heavy losses in both their matches, as they lost to Bangladesh by six wickets and then to hosts India by eight wickets. Afghanistan came into the match having lost 16 of their last 17 World Cup games, their only victory coming against Scotland in 2015. Phenomenal stuff from Afghanistan to turn over the defending champions tonight so convincingly. They put the hopes of a nation on their shoulders and made everyone proud.

<li>The … [+6903 chars]",Oman,"US forces sent naval drones to keep tabs on Iranian warships and gunboats around key Middle Eastern waters for several days last month, the US Navy revealed on Friday as Washington looks for ways to deter Tehran from consistently harassing foreign military and commercial ships in the region. The operation, which consisted of a dozen different unmanned platforms and manned ships, saw US assets track vessels belonging to Iran's two maritime forces — its regular navy and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) — over several days in September. US Naval Forces Central Command, or NAVCENT, said that the mission occurred ""during routine patrols"" in and around the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic waterway between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. ""This operation bolstered presence in and around a critical chokepoint that in recent months has seen Iran unlawfully seize internationally flagged merchant ships,"" NAVCENT said in astatement, adding that unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were all included. One USV known as the Arabian Fox MAST-13, which is similar in looks and size to a standard speedboat, captured photographs of Iranian fast-attack boats, drones, and helicopters. These fast-attack boats, which are armed with guns, routinely come out to monitor foreign activity in the area and are often called out forharassingAmerican military shipsand internationally flagged commercial vessels. In May, for instance, drone video shared by the US Navy showeda dozen of these speedboats swarmand seize a Panama-flagged oil tanker. Looking for more ways to surveil and patrol the Middle Eastern waters, the US Navy hasturned to a fleetof drone boats — operating both above and below the surface — for the job. In August 2022, the US Navy said it prevented the IRGC fromtrying to captureone of its USVs in the in the Persian Gulf. The following month, an Iranian ship managed tobriefly seizetwo American drone boats and even tried to hide them by placing them under a tarp. Tehran eventually released the systems the next day following US military intervention, and nothing of the sort has happened in the year since. ""We have been operating UAVs and UUVs in the region for years,"" said Capt. Joe Baggett, director of maritime operations for NAVCENT and US 5th Fleet, in the statement. ""Adding our new USVs, and then integrating all of these platforms into fleet operations, is how we expect to fly and sail well into the future."" An unmanned US Navy drone boat, a MAST-13,sailedthrough the Strait of Hormuz for the first time in April with the Iranians watching closely as it did. Other images from the September operation that were released by the US Navy on Friday showed an IRGCN warship and an Iranian Navy frigate. The IRGCN ship was photographed by a MARTAC T-38 Devil Ray USV, which looks similar to the Arabian Fox, while the frigate was captured by an Aerovel Flexrotor — a small UAV that is capable of vertical take off and landing. Service members from the US Marines, Navy, and Coast Guard, as well as aircraft and ships — including the guided-missile destroyer USS McFaul, across seven different task forces participated in last month's operation, according to NAVCENT. ""The integration of new, multidomain unmanned platforms into routine fleet operations provides more 'eyes on the water,' enhancing maritime domain awareness and increasing deterrence in the region,"" said Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, commander of NAVCENT and US 5th Fleet, adding that all these systems will help support the transit of goods around the Strait of Hormuz, which is considered to be one of the world's most important oil chokepoints and where scores ofIranian harassment incidentshave taken place in recent years. ""This enhanced maritime security serves as a deterrent against malign activity and strengthens regional stability, which is good for everybody,"" Cooper said. Beyond the naval drones, the Pentagon has also dispatched a collection offighter jets and warshipsto provide a firepower boost and added means of deterrence in the region. This includes the recent deployment ofover 3,000 US sailors and Marineswith the Bataan Amphibious Ready Group and 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit. Lt. Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich, the commander of US Air Forces Central Command (AFCENT), said this week that the added American military presence in the region — a mix of naval and airpower — ""has deterred Iran from taking any actions against maritime shipping."" ""My view is that deterrence is temporal,"" Grynkewich said at a Defense Writers Group event on Wednesday. He explained that the US is trying to message that the surge in forces is in response to a specific threat but even if the American force presence were to shrink and Iran steps up its activity again, they'll come right back. ""So my hope is that they've seen that message and that they remain deterred over the longer term, but it has had good effects in the meantime,"" Grynkewich said, according to atranscriptof his remarks."

<li>War broke out in the Middle East wit… [+6538 chars]",Oman,"The United States Congress is tragically failing when the world — not just the country — needs it to function most. The Senate's top foreign policy leader stepped down amid a wave of felony allegations, and the upper chamber can't advance so much as a military promotion because of one senator's pique. The House is leaderless, in chaos, and whoever takes the mantle of speaker will serve at the pleasure of the most extreme faction in the chamber. It's gridlock at the moment when two allies are in desperate need of support. On October 2, just under nine months after Rep. Kevin McCarthy made concessions to far-right House members to attain the speakership by making it easier for any one member to begin the process of removing a speaker, a single member took advantage of the rule change. Eight Republicans and the entirety of the Democratic Caucus ultimately banded together to oust Rep. Kevin McCarthy from being speaker — it couldn't have happened at a worse time. After a war broke out war in the Middle East between Israeli troops and Hamas forces over the weekend, there's a high demand from Israel for US financial and military assistance. While President Joe Bidensaid on Tuesdaythat some aid has already been sent, sending more will likely depend on the cooperation of Congress. The war in Israel isn't even the only overseas fight that Congress has been tasked with subsidizing: Ukrainian and Russian troops are still locked in heated combat, despite the US having already sent close to $113 billion to assist Ukraine in fending off Russian military advancements. Even if congressional leaders have any desire to dole out additional aid to Ukraine or fund the Israeli military's counter-operations against Hamas forces, without a speaker of the House, there's currently no way for the House of Representatives to even begin the bureaucratic legislative process to dole out any requested aid. The Republican Party in the House has been deadlocked for days over which member to replace McCarthy as speaker, with most coalescing to support one of two candidates: Rep. Steve Scalise or Rep. Jim Jordan. Republicans hold such a slim majority in the House that, while they only need a simple majority to elect a new speaker, just a few out-of-line members make it difficult to quickly come to a conclusion. To make things even more complicated, just as House Republicans most need to come together to find a new speaker, one of the caucus' members, Rep. George Santos, was justindicted in New Yorkand charged with fraud and identity theft. If Santos resigns, which he hasn't shown any indication of doing, it would leave Republicans with an even slimmer majority and make it even more difficult for the party to legislate. On top of being unable to push through any legislation to fund wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, without a speaker, the House also can't even work right now on vital appropriations bills to keep the US government funded at all. Warring GOP factions in the House very nearly led to the government shutting down at the end of September. The continuing resolution brokered by McCarthy to keep the lights on directly led Rep. Matt Gaetz to begin the process of ousting the former speaker. Even when the House of Representatives had a full-fledged speaker prior to McCarthy's boot, many of the GOP members appeared more focused and intent on trying to move forward an impeachment against Biden than ensuringmillions of government workers(including those in the military) continue to get paid and the government remains operational. With two major international conflicts that Congress is now being tasked with supporting and chaos in the House, it's critical that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee operates as seamlessly as possible to fill the multitude of ambassador vacancies — at the moment, several Middle Eastern countries such as Israel, Oman, and Kuwait do not have USambassadors. That, however, may not be entirely possible at the moment after Democratic committee Chairman Sen.Bob Menendez was indictedby a federal grand jury and accused of bribery. More than thirty Democratic senators have since called on him to resign, though he's maintained he's innocent. Additionally, in the Senate, GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville has unilaterally prevented more than 300 military service members from being promoted en masse by the Senate, per tradition, due to his frustration over the Pentagon's decision to reimburse service members who travel out of state for abortion-related services. Tuberville, a former college football coach who has no military experience himself but said ""there is nobody more military than me,"" has directly led to military leadership vacancies in the Middle East and some officers simultaneously staffing multiple positions (some as interim replacements) at once. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer could, in theory, file a cloture motion leading to a direct vote on a singular military promotion as the Senate did in late September. However, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin is currently out of commission recovering from a knee replacement, meaning there's one less possible Democratic vote on any contentious votes. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz has also personally had a hand in slowing down the Biden Administration's effort to fill the State Department's ""Coordinator for Counterterrorism"" position, havingblocked a nomineein June, accusing her of wrongdoing during her time as ambassador to Lebanon. Cruz isn't the only one.Politiconoted on Wednesday that there are several unnamed senators who are also blocking diplomatic nominees from moving forward. It ultimately appears like the Biden White House, an institution more known in recent weeks fordog bitesrather than diplomacy, is the only functioning branch of government at the moment. But with Biden also distracted with a presidential reelection campaign, possible impeachment proceedings, and his son embroiled in controversy, long-term stability is no guarantee."

Smith/AP Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images (2), Marcy Nighswander/APhide caption Clockwise from top left: Pushinka, a gift to President John F. Kennedy from Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev; Bo, President Barack Obama's Portuguese water dog; Commander, President Biden's German shepherd; and Socks, President Bill Clinton's cat. News that another of President Biden's German shepherds has been transferred from the White House to the proverbial doghouse brings to mind a veritable menagerie of first pets that have graced 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Since President George Washington, the White House has been home to cats, birds, and a variety of more exotic animals. Some have been immortalized in speeches, while others have found themselves at the center of controversy, with one even suspected ofespionage! President Martin Van Buren was on the receiving end of a pair of tiger cubs originally gifted to his predecessor, Andrew Jackson, by the Sultan of Oman. By the time they arrived in Washington, D.C., Van Buren was president and adamant about keeping the animals. But Congress insisted the cubs were the property of the U.S. government, not the chief executive, according to aNational Park Serviceaccount. ""In the end, the President lost his argument with Congress and gave the tiger cubs to a zoo,"" the park service says. PresidentsCalvin Coolidge and Teddy Roosevelt eachkept a strange collection of animals. Coolidge was gifted apygmy hippo named Billybut sent it to the National Zoo. Roosevelt, an avid outdoorsman, had the largest and most eclectic and exotic mix of pets, ranging from a badger to a hyena, as well as myriad farm animals. But it was a bulldog named Pete who proved to be trouble at the White House.Pete was ""sent packing"" after he ""bit the French Ambassador Jean Jules Jusserand, who was a good personal friend of the president's,"" according to theTheodore Roosevelt Center. For the Bidens, the kerfuffle over Commander is familiar ground. In the first months of the administration, another of the first family's dogs, Major, was sent  to Delaware to live after biting security personnel. In an odd historical parallel, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's German shepherd, also named Major, met a fate similar to Biden's dog. Andrew Hager, historian-in-residence at the Presidential Pet Museum, says FDR's Major had to be rehomed after ""[tearing] the pants of the British prime minister at the first state dinner Roosevelt gave in 1933."" There may be a lesson here: If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog. Just don't name him Major. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his car with his Scottish terrier, Fala, in 1941.Hulton Archive/Getty Imageshide caption President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his car with his Scottish terrier, Fala, in 1941. But it is FDR's Scottish terrier, Fala, who has earned an enduring place in history. In 1944, Roosevelt's opponents floated a story that Fala had been inadvertently left behind after the president visited Alaska aboard a U.S. Navy destroyer. To retrieve the dog, ""they had to turn the destroyer around and go back at a cost of several million dollars and at a risk to everybody,"" Hager says, relating the tale. There is no evidence that it ever happened, but Roosevelt, a Democrat, used the story in a1944 campaign speechto fire back at Republicans, who he said were no longer content with mere attacks ""on me, or on my wife or on my sons."" ""They now include my little dog Fala,"" the president said to laughter. ""It really sort of put the issue to rest,"" says Hager, who is also the author ofAll-American Dogs: A History of Presidential Pets from Every Era. Richard Nixon, Republican candidate for the vice presidency, explains an $18,000 expense fund on national television in September 1952. The appearance was nicknamed his ""Checkers speech"" because of his reference to the family dog.APhide caption Richard Nixon, Republican candidate for the vice presidency, explains an $18,000 expense fund on national television in September 1952. The appearance was nicknamed his ""Checkers speech"" because of his reference to the family dog. Richard Nixon may owe his political career to a black-and-white cocker spaniel named Checkers. The story dates not to his time in the White House, but to the 1952 campaign, when he was then-presidential candidate Dwight Eisenhower's running mate. A potential scandal involving an alleged Nixon secret political war chest was brewing and threatened to force Eisenhower to ax him from the ticket. In atelevised speech, Nixon countered critics, acknowledging that what he had done ""was wrong, just not illegal."" One gift he'd received from a supporter, he said, was a dog, Checkers. Taking a page from FDR, Nixon invoked his family — and the family pet — for political points. The dog, he said, had been named by his 6-year-old daughter, Tricia. ""And, you know, the kids, like all kids, loved the dog, and I just want to say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we are going to keep it,"" Nixon said. The ""Checkers speech"" is widely regarded as having rescued Nixon from political oblivion. During the Cold War intrigue of the 1960s, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave President John F. Kennedy a small mixed-breed dog from the litter of Strelka, one of two Russian mutts to have flown into space and returned safely. Pushinka (""fluffy"" in Russian) arrived in Washington, D.C., only to be whisked off to Walter Reed Army Medical Center to be poked, prodded and X-rayed by the Central Intelligence Agency.

""After a whole bunch of tests for bombs and germs and other listening devices ... [Pushinka] went on to fall in love with President Kennedy's beloved terrier, Charlie, and had puppies that were coined pupniks,"" she says. Kennedy's successor, President Lyndon Johnson, infamously caught flak for a photograph that showed him picking up one of his beagles by the ears, apparently to encourage him to bark for guests. When the photo appeared inLifemagazine, ""the public reaction was swift and vehement. In letters and phone calls to the White House, in newspaper editorials, on TV and radio talk shows, LBJ was denounced for animal cruelty,"" according to theAmerican Kennel Club. But Pickens argues that it was overblown. ""President Johnson was one of the greatest animal lovers of all times, especially dog lovers,"" she says. ""He loved those beagles. I think that was just a sad mishap of the media kind of going crazy over a moment.""

The cat was receiving so much fan mail that Indiana Republican Rep. Dan Burtonrequested dataon how much it cost the White House to process the correspondence. Finally, there was the kerfuffle over President Barack Obama's Portuguese water dog, Bo. During the campaign, the Obamas said they had promised their daughters, Sasha and Malia, they would get a dog after the election. They ""repeatedly said they wanted it to be a rescued dog such as one from a shelter,"" The Associated Presssaid. However, ""Their search was complicated by daughter Malia's allergies, which would rule out many of the 'mutts' the president has said he would prefer,"" according to the AP. Sen. Edward Kennedy and his wife, Victoria, recommended a Portuguese water dog, a breed witha reputation for being hypoallergenic.Bo came from a Massachusetts breeder after the dog was returned by its first owner. Technically a rescue? ""He's in a gray area,"" the AP quoted then-chief executive of The Humane Society of the United States Wayne Pacelle as saying. Bo is a ""quasi-rescue dog,"" he said. ""But I will say that many animal advocates are disappointed that he (Obama) didn't go to a shelter or breed rescue group,"" Pacelle said. Sunny, another Portuguese water dog adopted later in the Obama presidency, also had a biting incident involving an 18-year-old family friend, leaving ""a nasty gash under the girl's eye,"" according toTMZ. Despite the occasional controversies, pets more often than not are viewed as a positive in the White House, says Pickens.

Pulitzer Prize-winning commentator Thomas Friedman in the late 1990s famously claimed that two countries with McDonald’s outlets had never gone to war. But as fighting rages between Israel and Hamas, the iconic American fast food chain is at war with itself. McDonald’s franchises in the Middle East have weighed in on opposing sides of the conflict, with branches in Muslim countries disavowing a decision by McDonald’s Israel to provide free meals to the Israeli military. Franchises in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt, Bahrain and Turkey have distanced themselves from their Israeli counterpart and collectively pledged more than $3m to support Palestinians under bombardment in Gaza. “Let us all combine our efforts and support the community in Gaza with everything we can,” McDonald’s Oman, which pledged $100,000 towards humanitarian relief efforts in Gaza, posted on X on Sunday. “We ask God Almighty to protect our beloved country and all Arab and Muslim countries from all the evil and hate.” Statement from McDonald’s Omanpic.twitter.com/SzKz7lhmgk — McDonald’s Oman (@Mcdonaldsoman)October 14, 2023  Since announcing its support for the Israeli army, McDonald’s Israel has changed its Instagram account to “private” following a backlash from consumers in Arab and Muslim countries. While McDonald’s ranks among the most iconic American brands, most of its restaurants worldwide are locally owned and operated. McDonald’s headquarters in Chicago, the United States did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. The case of McDonald’s highlights the tricky geopolitical dynamics that globe-spanning brands must navigate in an era where businesses are often expected to weigh in on hot-button social and political issues. The controversy has also revived discussion of the so-called Golden Arches theory of conflict prevention, popularised by Friedman in his 1999 book The Lexus and The Olive Tree. The theory – that countries with enough wealth and stability to support major chains like McDonald’s do not go to war with each other – has been widely discredited after conflicts between countries with the brand, including the 1998-99 Kosovo War and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. McDonald’s does not have any outlets in Gaza or the occupied West Bank but Israel has clashed with Hezbollah fighters in neighbouring Lebanon, which does have the American chain. “We’re in a post-‘Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention’ world now for sure,” Paul Musgrave, an associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told Al Jazeera. “Even though Russia and Ukraine both had McDonald’s in 2022, they still went to war. Now, conflicts within the McDonald’s empire mirror the real stresses and passions of the region.” McDonald’s is not the first global brand to be drawn into controversy due to its stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict. United Kingdom-based multinational Unilever came under fire from investors last year for failing to disclose that its ice cream brand subsidiary Ben and Jerry’s had decided to boycott Israeli-occupied territory in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2021. Spanish retailer Zara was boycotted by some shoppers last year after the chairman of its Israeli franchise, Canadian-Israeli businessman Joey Schwebel, hosted a campaign event for far-right Israeli minister Itamar Ben-Gvir at his home. Major brands have also found themselves drawn into controversies about the human rights records of other countries such as China. In 2021, Japanese retailer MUJI faced criticism after publicly endorsing cotton grown in China’s Xinjiang region, where human rights activists say ethnic minority Muslims are exploited for forced labour. Musgrave said that “the dream that capitalism and trade would quiet nationalism and other forms of fervour has been revealed to have some holes”. “Having different franchises of McDonald’s end up on different [rhetorical] sides is another example of how politics permeates everything.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

The Palestinian envoy to the United Nations has implored member states to vote to end the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip and to increase aid deliveries to the 2.3 million Palestinians living in the besieged territory. “I appeal to all of you to vote to stop the killing. Vote for humanitarian aid to reach those whose very survival depends on it. Vote to stop this madness,” Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour said in an emotional speech to the UN General Assembly on Thursday. Arguing for a ceasefire, Mansour said certain nations that he did not name were applying a double standard on the conflict. “How can representatives of states explain how horrible it is that 1,000 Israelis were killed and not feel the same outrage when 1,000 Palestinians are now killed every single day?” Mansour asked the assembly. “Why not feel a sense of urgency to end their killing?” The 193-nation General Assembly met for an emergency session as aid agencies and rights groups warned that humanitarian conditions in Gaza are at a critical point more than two weeks into a relentlessIsraeli assault. Israel has bombarded the Palestinian territory since Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,400 people in attacks on southern Israel, according to Israeli officials. More than 7,000 people have been killed in the Israeli bombardment, according to Gaza authorities, and Israel has also cut off supplies of food, water, electricity and fuel to the territory. Addressing the General Assembly, Israeli envoyGilad Erdandescribed the Hamas attack as a “pogrom”. “The rockets were only cover for the pogrom that followed. Barbaric Hamas terrorists invaded Israel from the sea, the land and the air,” Erdan said. “They came with one purpose: to savagely murder every living thing they encountered.”       Erdan made the comments as the assembly began a two-day meeting on the Middle East. It is due to vote on Friday on a resolution drafted by Arab states that calls for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Speaking on behalf of Arab states, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi accused Israel of “making Gaza a perpetual hell on earth. The trauma will haunt generations to come.” He said the impact on Palestinian civilians is immense. The Israeli siege and assault on Gaza has prompted agrowing outcryas the death toll continues to rise and aid officials warn of an imminent humanitarian catastrophe. Medical services in Gaza have been nearbreaking pointfor days with fuel supplies strained by Israel’s siege of the strip. On Thursday, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) warned that its fuel stocks werealmost out, and the agency had been forced to suspend “life-saving services”.      International leaders have also expressed concern that an anticipated Israeliground invasionof Gaza could spark a wider escalation across the region. In a speech at the UN on Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minster Hossein Amirabdollahian warned that his country did not want to see fighting escalate but “if the genocide in Gaza continues, they will not be spared from this fire.” In a joint statement on Thursday, the Arab states of Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates condemned what they called Israel’s collective punishment and mass displacement of Palestinians. Human rights groups such as Amnesty International have stressed the need for aceasefireto bring the bloodshed to an end and avoid the chance of fighting spilling over into neighbouring countries. Meanwhile, a delegation of Hamas leaders arrived on Thursday inRussia, where officials said Iran’s deputy foreign minister was also visiting. Israel condemned Russia, which has ties to all parties involved in the current round of fighting, for hosting members of Hamas, describing the group as “worse than ISIS”.

Islamabad, Pakistan– Last week, Englishman Stephen Constantine was named as the new coach of the Pakistani men’s national football team and tasked with ending a dire run by winning the country’s first-ever World Cup qualification match and, in the process, ending a five-year, 13-match losing streak. Constantine’s squad arrived in Cambodia in the early hours of Monday for the first leg of a 2026 World Cup first-round qualifier, set to take place on Thursday. Cambodia were also Pakistan’s opponents in their previous qualifying tie four years ago, which the Southeast Asian team won 4-1 on aggregate. Pakistan are currently ranked 197th out of 207 teams globally, while Cambodia are ranked 177th. Speaking to reporters in Lahore on October 4 after the 25-member squad was announced, Constantine said he realised the scale of the challenges. “I cannot predict, nor will I predict what’s going to happen over the two games. But I think that people will see a very different Pakistan,” he said, referring to the return leg on October 17 in Islamabad. Constantine – who was appointed by the FIFA-led Normalisation Committee (NC) currently running the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) – previously coached India’s national team. He led India from a rank of 173rd in 2015 to 97th in December 2018, while also helping them qualify for the 2019 Asian Cup. However, the experienced coach will have a far bigger task on his hands with Pakistan. While India also has a well-organised domestic league in place, Pakistani football haslong been adrift– despite the game’s popularity in the country.      The PFF has beensuspended twice by FIFAin the last six years due to political interference, while the country of more than 240 million people has not had a functioning football league for more than a year due to a lack of funds and infrastructure. Its footballing affairs are run by the NC, headed by Haroon Malik, a Canadian-Pakistani businessman, since 2020, with the mandate to strengthen football administration and hold transparent PFF elections. Speaking to Al Jazeera on the day the squad was announced, Malik agreed that there are “plenty of administrative issues” but said the crisis in Pakistani football has been decades in the making. “We also lacked broadcast rights and sponsorship, leaving us with barely any funds,” he said. “However, we are gradually setting up infrastructure, we have started organising district level football championships across the country and the way things are moving, I am very hopeful we will announce a top-tier football league by March 2024 next year.” Malik said since June 2022, whenFIFA lifteda 14-month-long suspension on PFF, his aim was also to provide as many opportunities as possible for Pakistan to play matches. After not playing an international game since June 2019, Pakistan played eight matches between November 2022 and June 2023, including five friendlies, but lost all – conceding 18 goals in the process and scoring just one. “We acknowledge the challenges we have, and it is reflected in our team’s ranking and the performance in the field,” Malik said.      Ali Ahsan, the editor of FootballPakistan.Com, an online platform covering Pakistani football, says football remains “underdeveloped, fragmented, and poorly run at all levels” in Pakistan – a fact reflected in its fortunes. “Despite it being the second most popular sport in the country after cricket, football has never professionalised domestically, nor has it kept pace with the sport across Asia, let alone the world,” he told Al Jazeera. Since it first entered World Cup qualifying, for Italia 1990, the Pakistani national team has never won a qualification match; it has managed to draw only three of 32 games, scoring 10 goals while conceding 124. Ahsan believes that one of the key issues hampering Pakistani football over the last three decades has been incessant political meddling. “When there is constant factionalism and infighting, nobody cares for anything beyond grabbing power for their own self-image,” Ahsan said, adding that occasional FIFA suspensions halt any footballing progress in the country. Football journalist Umaid Wasim concurs, saying the biggest problem with the sport has been its poor governance. “The PFF has almost always been run by politicians who have been power hungry,” he told Al Jazeera. “When the NC took over, it was hoped that things might improve but even their tenure has been found wanting.”      The PFF suspensions in 2017 and 2021 by FIFA were over “undue third-party interference”, and while both times the PFF was reinstated within about a year, the personal and political factionalism within board officials means players have suffered the most. Former Pakistan captain Saddam Hussain, a 30-year-old defensive midfielder with 21 caps, currently plays in the second tier of Oman’s domestic league for Salalah SC but was not selected in the latest squad. He told Al Jazeera that the “personal likes and dislikes” of players among the football administration have damaged the national team’s selection and performances. “I am playing here in Oman; I am obviously fit to perform. But I was not selected. What more do I want as a football player than performing for my own country?” Hussain said. “I am here in Oman because they think I can offer something and I have some quality. But I was not called up at all.” Kaleemullah Khan, another frequently capped playerconspicuous by his absence from the latest Pakistani squad, says that lack of grassroots development and football officials’ self-interest have hurt the national team the most. “Football was never the priority,” the striker, who has four international goals to his name, told Al Jazeera. “Funds given by FIFA were used for personal means.” Malik said that Pakistan has not received FIFA goal project funds since 2015/16 due to allegations of embezzlement. “However, since the time PFF has its suspension lifted in June last year, there are no such accusations and we are in fact working towards reviving the goal project funding from FIFA,” he said. “The question about embezzling funds is obviously very politically charged, but it happened in the past and I don’t have any comments to make on it.” Kaleemullah, who now plays for a club in Karachi, says unless the domestic football league is firmly established, the country’s performance will remain “substandard”. “Our national team last played in June in South Asian games and our World Cup qualifier was scheduled for October. In the last three months, what have our players done?” Kaleemullah said.      While the Pakistan team has seven diaspora players, some observers are sceptical that their inclusion will help the country’s fortunes in the upcoming matches. “The diaspora players who opt to play for Pakistan are often those who fail to make a mark in the countries they’re playing in,” Wasim, the journalist, said. “For their inclusion to work, not only do we need to cherry-pick the top diaspora talent but also have a domestic structure which produces top quality players.” So, with a less-than-ideal preparation for the all-important qualifiers against Cambodia, can Pakistan arrest their slide and make history? Kaleemullah says it is possible, but he is not very optimistic. “Footballing-wise, Cambodia are far ahead of us. They have a cohesive team practising together for some time. They have a domestic league structure,” he said. “We don’t know how long our players can maintain stamina or deal with pressure.” Football Pakistan’s Ahsan, however, remains cautiously optimistic, pinning his hopes on the appointment of Constantine. “If we can keep things simple and play cautiously to emerge unscathed in the first leg, perhaps we can go all out during the return leg in Islamabad,” he said. “That could hopefully lead us to qualify for the group stage of qualifiers.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Standing in the leafy reserve, shielded from the fierce sun, she says the Al-Qurm forest's 80 protected hectares (197 acres) of mangroves could lock away thousands of tons of CO2. ""Mangroves are the richest carbon sink in the world,"" says Afifi, wearing boots and a white lab coat as she leads a group of university students around the swamp. If the shoreline trees and bushes have become part of efforts to cut atmospheric CO2, oil-producing Oman, on the Arabian peninsula's southeast, has led the way in this hydrocarbon-rich region. Inspired by the late ruler Sultan Qaboos bin Said, a renowned conservationist who died in 2020, the country of 4.5 million people has become the Gulf's centre for mangrove restoration and preservation. Mangrove habitats can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a faster rate than forests and store it in their soil and sediment for longer periods. ""Mangroves are recognised as one of the nature-based solutions to fight climate change,"" says Afifi, 41. Up to 80 tons of CO2 per hectare could be stored in Al-Qurm's above-ground biomass, and even more in the muddy sediments below, she adds. Oman, a minor oil producer compared with its neighbours the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, is moving quickly in its project to revive the forests that once covered the country, but died out thousands of years ago because of climatic changes. The reason for its haste is modern, man-made climate change -- much of it from burning fossil fuels -- which risks destroying the mangroves with higher temperatures, floods and cyclones. ""If we are not going to restore more forests, it means maybe one day we will lose them"" due to climate change, Afifi says. Trudging through a murky creek north of Muscat, Badr bin Saif Al Busaidi of Oman's environmental authority points to a dense thicket of mangrove trees. ""There was not a single tree here"" two decades ago, the 40-year-old tells AFP from the Al-Sawadi creek, his boots ankle-deep in water. ""Now, it is a forest that stretches more than four kilometres (2.5 miles)"" with 88 hectares of mangrove cover, says Busaidi. Since 2001, a restoration project has revived these biodiversity hotspots that now cover around 1,000 hectares across the country's coast. Over the past two years, Oman has planted more than 3.5 million seeds directly in targeted areas, including a record two million this year. ""Next year the numbers will be even higher,"" Busaidi says, adding: ""We are living what we can call a war with nature because of climate change. ""If we don't take action, we will lose these natural resources."" Oman's restoration project has evolved slowly. At first it relied on mangrove nurseries, two of which are in Al-Qurm, growing 850,000 seedlings for transfer to coastal areas. In 2021, the conservationists tried using drones to disperse seeds, but after disappointing results they focused on the current approach of direct, targeted planting. Oman is also helping fulfil carbon credit schemes which have become popular tools for companies seeking to offset their carbon emissions. A single credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide removed or reduced from the atmosphere. Credits are generated through activities such as planting mangroves or rehabilitating forests. This month, the environment authority signed a contract with Oman's MSA Green Projects Company to plant 100 million trees over four years. As part of the initiative, 20,000 hectares of land in Al Wusta governorate will be transformed into mangrove habitats, partly using artificial lakes. Once completed, the project is predicted to eliminate 14 million tonnes of CO2 and generate $150 million through carbon credit certificates, the environmental authority said. Carbon credits' legitimacy has come under scrutiny as the trees must grow to maturity and never burn down if they are to permanently store CO2. Monitoring and certification standards can be slack, reports have found. Oman's carbon offsets could also be measured against its emissions, which amounted to 71 million tonnes of CO2 in 2021 according to the Global Carbon Project. ""Past generations didn't think much about the environment because the impact of climate change"" was not as apparent then, student Israa al-Maskari says at a mangrove nursery in Al-Qurm. ""What they did, we now face so we have to save our environment for us and for future generations."""

Hamas, the group that rulesGaza, should not be confused with all Palestinians, Spain’s top diplomat has said as the country expresses opposition to the proposed suspension of European Union aid to the Palestinian territories. The Spanish Acting Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said on Tuesday that Palestinian territories would likely need more aid soon after Hamas’s Saturday attack on Israel andIsrael’s subsequent bombardmentof the Gaza Strip. “This cooperation must continue; we cannot confuse Hamas, which is in the list of EU’s terrorist groups, with the Palestinian population, or the Palestinian Authority or the United Nation’s organisations on the ground,” Albares said in an interview with Spanish radio Cadena SER. EU foreign ministers will meet on the sidelines of a meeting in Oman on the situation in Israel and Gaza to discuss the funding issue on Tuesday after European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi said on Monday on social media platform X that 691 million euros ($728m) in aid had been suspended.      The European Commission contradicted Varhelyi’s statement, saying that payments were not suspended and that it was merely reviewing aid to Palestinian territories. Officials also stressed that the review applies only to development funding, not to the separate EU humanitarian aid budget for Palestinians. Even though countries such as Austria and Germany have announced the end of funding to Palestinian territories, others such as Spain, France and Luxembourg consider the aid flow crucial for the civilian population. Suspending aid would be “counterproductive”, Albares said. France’s foreign ministry also said it was “not in favour of suspending aid which directly benefits the Palestinian populations”, adding that it had “made this known to the EU Commission”. Last year, France contributed 95 million euros ($101m) in aid to the Palestinians in Gaza, annexed east Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank run by the Palestinian Authority, and refugee camps in neighbouring countries. “This aid is focused on supporting the Palestinian populations, in water, health, food security and education,” added the ministry. Distributed through the United Nations, it “directly benefits the Palestinian people” and is “fully in line with the engagements of France”, the ministry added.  Luxembourg’s Acting Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn also insisted that his government did not support the suspension of aid. “Two million people live in Gaza. They are also hostages of Hamas. With these methods, we push them into the arms of terrorists,” he said. “We are the largest donor to Gaza. This help is important for young people. This is not money for Hamas. It is for the people of Gaza,” he told the AFP news agency. But the suspension may be supported by other EU states, including the richest, Germany, which announced that it was suspending its own direct aid to the Palestinians. “It is being examined, that is, temporarily suspended,” said a spokeswoman from the German ministry for economic cooperation and development. The EU announced in February it was contributing 296 million euros for the 2022 budget to help the Palestinian Authority pay civil servant salaries, pensions, healthcare and infrastructure projects. The bloc says it would provide “up to 1.177 billion euros in financial support from 2021 to 2024”. A European Commission spokeswoman insisted earlier on Monday EU aid “does not fund Hamas or any other terrorist organisation activities, either directly or indirectly”.

The Palestine issue was the pivot of regional geopolitics for decades, but some Arab leaders had recently come forward to sidestep the issue to normalize ties with Israel. However, the recent flashpoint in the Israel-Palestine conflict has thrust the issue back into the limelight and left countries of the Arab world taking different stances. The war has been going on for a week since Hamas fighters stormed Israel by air, land and sea last Saturday, which caught Tel Aviv completely by surprise. In retaliation, Israeli forces have been pummeling Gaza with airstrikes and shelling. Israel said Friday that it attacked 750 ""military targets"" overnight in the densely populated Gaza Strip. Gaza's ruling Hamas group urged Palestinian citizens to protest in Al-Aqsa Mosque compound Friday. ""By continuing with its carpet bombing, [Israel] is re-enacting variety of Holocaust in slow motion with the enthusiastic support of the camp that supports it,"" KP Fabian, former ambassador of India to Qatar, Iran and other countries, toldInternational Business Times. The camp that supports Israel is fiercely shepherded by the U.S., which has comprehensively supported the country with both military and financial aid following the Hamas attack. Vivek Mishra, a fellow with Observer Research Foundation's strategic studies program, believes the U.S. backing its staunch ally may dissuade other players from getting involved in the conflict. The military aid to Israel ""control any further regional escalation that could potentially embroil other countries such as Iran and Syria,"" MishratoldIBT. ""The U.S. military support to Israel plays a critical role in preventing the conflict from spreading beyond the region and discouraging the involvement of other major players like Russia and China,"" he added. ""However, if the conflict expands to involve Iran and Syria, it is likely that Russia will not remain passive but may become involved."" Prior to the Hamas attack, the Biden administration had put considerable efforts into normalizing ties between Israel and Arab nations, especially Saudi Arabia, which has never recognized Israel as a state. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said weeks before the Hamas attack that the two countries were growing ""closer"" every day but noted that the treatment of Palestinians is still ""very important."" However, after the Hamas attack, the ""Israeli-Saudi Arabia normalization has been set back by at least months, if not years,"" Kabir Taneja, an expert on foreign policy, West Asia and counter-terrorism, toldIBT. Saudi Arabia called for de-escalation of the conflict and showed support for a two-state solution in favor of Palestine. Thecrown prince""underscored the Kingdom's unwavering stance in standing up for the Palestinian cause and supporting efforts aimed at achieving comprehensive and fair peace that ensures the Palestinian people's legitimate rights,"" Saudi's foreign ministry said in a statement Thursday. The crown prince also had a phone call with the president of Iran. Following the Hamas attack, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said they ""kiss the hands of those who planned the attack on the Zionist regime."" The Hamas attack is widely unsupported, but the Palestine cause has gotten ""a revival of sorts"" because of the ongoing violence, Taneja added. Over the past years, the Palestinian cause somewhat took a backseat due to geopolitical shifts, the regional re-prioritization of domestic economic needs and Washington's push for better ties in the Middle East. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously trivialized the Palestine issue as outdated, saying Arab states looking to establish ties with his country merely saw the issue as a ""check box"" during discussions. The U.S.-led ""Abraham Accords"", signed in September 2020, changed the dynamics in the region and signaled a wider normalization between Israel and the Arab states. Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, which are signatories of the Abraham Accords, took a more ""cautious tone"" in their response following the Hamas attack, while countries like Qatar, Oman and Kuwait blamed Israel's policies for the violence. ""If you see the regional perspective, all countries including the Arab countries took different lines. The Bahrainis and the Emiratis in the UAE took a more cautious tone. They said that the revival of the peace processes should be prioritized. They are also trying to save the Abraham Accords. This was something that all of them would have feared at some point,"" Taneja said. ""The Omanis and the Qataris and the Kuwaitis outright blame Israel and Israeli action for what happened."" He noted that Egypt and Jordan appear to have taken a ""middle of the path"" approach. ""It's been a fracture between supporting the Palestinian cause but also securing your larger strategic interest that go much beyond the Palestine issue now. Earlier it was just the Palestine issue; now it goes beyond. So it's a difficult and tricky business to be in for a lot of these countries,"" Taneja explained. Due to the Israel-Hamas war, ""the strategic divide in the Middle East with Israel and the Arab countries on the one side and Iran, Syria, Lebanon on the other side will be further deepened,"" S. Samuel C. Rajiv, author of ""The India-Israel Strategic Partnership: Contours, Opportunities and Challenges,"" toldIBT. ""If the Israel-Hamas conflict expands to involve other protagonists, it could lead to a further deterioration of the regional strategic situation. Progress on initiatives like the India Middle East Economic Corridor could be impacted,"" he said. ""There should be no impact on the work of mini-lateral groupings like I2U2 (made up of India, Israel, the U.S. and the UAE). Most of the I2U2 projects relating to food security or clean energy are being established in India, funded by the U.S. or the UAE."" While countries like UAE and Bahrain secure their positions, ""they are also very cognizant of the fact that the people, their own populations, are still very pro-Palestine. They can react to this with street protests and street movements and maybe demand that the Abraham Accords be canceled,"" Rajiv noted. Rallies to show support for Palestine have taken place across the Middle East region, including in countries like Bahrain, Morocco, Turkey, Yemen, Tunisia and Kuwait, following the eruption of violence."

The shift, contrary to the criticism of it, is not about India abandoning the Palestine cause. It has to do with replacing the traditional diplomatic formalism and a defensive political correctness with a policy rooted in a hard-headed assessment of the shifting regional dynamic, and India’s enduring interests, especially in relation to terrorism. In the past, India voted with the Arab resolutions against Israel as a matter of routine; Delhi also ducked the question of terrorism emanating from the Arab world. With its latest vote on the latest UNGA resolution, Delhi has underlined the primacy of its concerns on international terrorism without abandoning its demand for a two-state solution in Palestine. While the new realism is welcome, theBJPgovernment needs to guard against inviting the charge it used to level against the Congress party’s Middle East policy — of playing “vote bank” politics with a region that is of vital interest to India. India’s challenge is not with the nature of its UNGA vote that is non-binding and, in any case, ineffective. That nearly 140 nations in the UNGA have demanded that Russia end itsUkraineaggression over the last two years have had little impact on Moscow’s policy. In the hyper-realist world of the Middle East, the UN is not where the volatile region’s fate will be decided.Delhi’s real diplomatic task, therefore, lies outside the UN. It has three dimensions. First is to step up outreach to the Arab world and explain Delhi’s abiding commitment to Palestine’s full statehood, publicly press Israel to respect the laws of war, and shore up humanitarian assistance to Gaza. Prime MinisterNarendra Modi’s recent telephone calls to moderate leaders of the Arab world, including Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, King Hussein of Jordan, Sultan of Oman Haitham bin Tarik and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, is a welcome first step. Delhi’s relations with the Arab leaders have never been as good as they are today, but India needs to complement it with a major diplomatic and political outreach to the Arab Street that is outraged by Israel’s brutal repression in Gaza and its current military operations. Second, the government needs to invite Opposition leaders for a full briefing and explain the considerations shaping its regional policy. By all accounts, the Opposition’s thinking on the Middle East is frozen in the past and an update is long overdue. And the serial blasts in Kerala on Sunday have underlined that both sides have a stake in insulating domestic politics from the Middle East crisis. Finally, Delhi can ill-afford to send out the impression that it is preventing pro-Palestine protests while encouraging demonstrations in support of Israel by groups on the other side of the ideological fence. Delhi needs to crack down on the extremist groups that are reportedly spreading disinformation in favour of Tel Aviv and participating in cyber attacks against Hamas sites. The BJP government cannot let fringe groups undermine its carefully crafted strategy of interest-based realism in the Middle East."

According to scientists, Cyclone Tej is headed in the northwesterly direction ringing in rain activity in Yemen, owing to whichMumbaias well as the entire west coast is slated to receive no rainfall even after the cyclone’s complete development. Sushma Nair toldThe Indian Express, “Currently, Cyclone Tej has formed a deep depression and within the next 24 hours, it will develop completely. However, the cyclone is slated to bring activity in Yemen and if it travels, then, it will result in developments in Oman. It must be noted that Cyclone Tej is nowhere near the west coast owing to which neither Mumbai nor any other parts of the country will receive showers because of this cyclone. The AQI levels could have gone down had there been any rain activity. But now, the AQI will remain unaffected.” Read Death By Breath Series – Mumbai holds its breath|Why construction dust is lethal|BMC’s rulebook gets a burial A mere two weeks after the withdrawal of monsoon, Mumbai has been reeling under burgeoning AQI levels as well as high temperatures in the ongoing week. While the average AQI on Monday touched 184 in Mumbai, on Wednesday, as the city’s temperature soared to a four-year high for October, levels of PM10 — Particulate Matter. A day earlier, Mumbai’s overall AQI touched 191, way worse thanDelhi’s 84. Responding to questions from Express, Nair explained, “Currently, the wind circulation has been such that the air couldn’t rise because of which dust particles remained suspended in the air resulting in rising AQI levels.” Meanwhile, Mahesh Palawat from Skymet Weather Services added that dust from construction sites, dry weather, high temperatures and lack of winds have resulted in the increased AQI levels in the city, post monsoon withdrawal. On Friday, pockets of Mumbai Metropolitan Region experienced light drizzle which meteorologists as well as weather experts attributed to a trough in the north coast of Maharashtra. Despite the showers, they maintained that the AQI level will not witness a decline.  Speaking to The Indian Express, Palawat said, “There is a small trough in the north coast of Maharashtra which may bring light rain but it won’t prevail. The AQI levels in the city are not slated to drop unless there is prolonged rain activity. The current spells have no connection to Cyclone Tej as it is far away in the east-central Arabian Sea.” On the question of the worsening air quality, Bhagwan Kesbhat, CEO of Waatavaran Foundation said that the civic body needs to take serious interventions to combat the issue. “Construction and other demolition works generate PM 10 in the air which causes major breathing issues amongst people, especially children and the elderly. Following the withdrawal of monsoon, the moisture levels remain high while temperatures dip in the night, the dust particles cannot be suppressed and remain suspended in the air. The BMC needs to come with serious, long term solutions unlike the smog guns which only settles down the dust temporarily,” said Kesbhat"

""While Oman and Arizona may be geographically distant, our shared commitment to sustainable development, border security, and military resiliency highlight the strength of the partnership,"" said Maj. Gen. Kerry L. Muehlenbeck, director of Arizona's Department of Emergency and Military Affairs and Arizona National Guard's adjutant general. ""Together, we demonstrate that collaboration knows no boundaries and may lead to mutual growth and prosperity."" The delegation visited the 161st Air Refueling Wing and 162nd Fighter Wing, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the University of Arizona Biosphere and campus, and the Arizona State University campus, learning about Guard capabilities and state resources. Topics discussed included emergency management, cybersecurity, sustainable energy, border security and processing, and critical infrastructure. ""Arizona National Guard is excited to build the relationship with Oman through the State Partnership Program and expand with a whole-of-government approach to grow ties between the public and private sectors for long-term mutual benefit and understanding,"" said Col. Pete Caffrey, State Partnership Program coordinator. The Arizona National Guard entered the SPP as an original ally, partnering with the Republic of Kazakhstan in 1993. These collaborations create enduring partnerships that strengthen our partners and allies, assist combatant commanders, and enhance regional security. This program's innovative, low-cost, small-footprint approach has resulted in productive partnerships with 100 nations around the globe. The Arizona National Guard is looking forward to bolstering its new partnership through exercises, co-deployments and key-leader engagements in the United States and Oman.  "

The result is ""many of the (gulf's) species live close to their physiological limits,"" the article says.A rise in temperature and salinity and a decrease in pH and dissolved oxygen ""all make the gulf a laboratory for the most acute effects of future climate change,"" the report says.It says the gulf ""is also a hotspot for rapid coastal development"" and suffers pollution from the oil industry, all of which are damaging tocoral reefs, mangroves, mudgrass and seagrass habitats.The situation has gotten so perilous that the only source of freshwater into the gulf, the Shatt Al-Arab River at the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates, has reversed its flow, says Nadia Al-Mudaffar Fawzi, a retired professor from the University of Basra, one of the report's co-authors.The river's increased salinity threatens freshwater supplies in Basra, Iraq, says Al-Mudaffar Fawzi, whom Helmuth says has a courtesy appointment at Northeastern as a visiting professor due to their collaborations.""Most of the issues come from political issues between the countries,"" says Al-Mudaffar Fawzi, who adds that the decreased river flow stems from the water's diversion upstream for electricity and agriculture.""That's where we came up with the idea of scientists working together,"" she says.""Scientists can act really fast, we can be nimble,"" Helmuth says. ""We can respond quickly because we've already established relationships"" with organizations such as the Gulf Cooperation Council.Marine animal sanctuaries and stranding networksThe article in theRoyal Society Open Sciencejournal lays out an agenda that includes developing a regional network of scientists who can share data, work together on regional habitat mapping and identify gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed.It also recommends establishing the gulf's first marine mammal stranding network as well as marine animal sanctuaries, called peace parks.Marine animals including large mammals like whales and dugongs, a relative of the manatee, ""ignore geopolitical boundaries"" in their movements, Helmuth says.The paper recommends establishing the gulf's first ""transboundary marine park"" in an area shared by Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia that is home to thriving dugong populations.""The park might involve collaboration on pollution control. It can simply involve just protection from development,"" Helmuth says.Smithsonian gets involvedThe Smithsonian Institution convened the first meeting in January 2022 of the authors of the report, who have been meeting periodically ever since, says Helmuth, who has worked with Al-Mudaffar Fawzi and other scientists from Iraq for the past dozen years or so.Al-Mudaffar Fawzi says the authors also include researchers from Iran and the Arab Gulf states. Individuals who are working in but not from Oman and Saudi Arabia also contributed to the report.""This group worked wonderfully together. It was a really good experience. Hopefully it will continue with more people.

The summit in Oman was dominated by the ongoing war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas. With Bahrain and the UAE having normalized relations with Israel in 2020 and Saudi Arabia currently in American-mediated talks to follow suit, Szijjarto warned that“the terrible events of recent days could jeopardize the results of the peacemaking effort thus far.” “The most important thing now is to prevent the escalation of the conflict,”the Hungarian diplomat wrote in a separate Facebook post on Monday.“The Arab states of the Gulf area have a key role in this, that is why the meeting of foreign ministers of the EU-Gulf states… has great significance.” The Hungarian government has taken a similar stance on the conflict in Ukraine, with Szijjarto and Prime Minister Viktor Orban repeatedly calling for a ceasefire and peace talks, all while opposing further EU military aid to Kiev and refusing to allow Western weapons to enter Ukraine from Hungarian territory. Hungary has also accused EU leaders of escalating the fighting in Ukraine to the detriment of its own economy and at the risk of provoking a global war. “Every time there is a war outside Europe, the EU looks down from a moral high ground and calls for peace, negotiations and an immediate end to the violence. But when the war is in Europe, the EU fuels the conflict and supplies weapons,”Szijjarto told Hungarian newspaper Magyar Nemzet last week. Less than four days after Szijjarto spoke with Magyar Nemzet, the EU issued a statement condemning Hamas and backing Israel’s“right to defend itself.”The statement concluded with a call for a “lasting and sustainable peace through reinvigorated efforts in the Middle East Peace Process.” The bloc has also continued its aid payments to the Palestinian Authority. Hamas launched a full-scale attack on Israel on Saturday, with its militants firing salvos of rockets at Israeli cities and storming Jewish settlements near the Gaza border. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by declaring a state of war and launching airstrikes on densely-populated Gaza. As of Tuesday, more than 1,000 Israelis and nearly 800 Palestinians have been killed, according to figures from each side."

Amid a growing backlash against McDonald’s over its apparent support for Israel’s war on Gaza, local McDonald’s franchises in Oman, Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates responded with donations to the Palestinian cause, along with reminders that each individual country’s McDonald’s business is independent of other national operators. Revealing it had donated $100,000 “towards the relief efforts for the people of Gaza” in a post to X on Saturday, McDonald’s Oman reminded customers that it was wholly independent of its Israeli counterpart and that each made their decisions –political and otherwise– without consulting the global McDonald’s Corporation, which supposedly abstains from politics. Saudi Arabia’s McDonald’s subsidiary revealed it had donated two million riyals ($533,000) to Gaza, in a post to X that included a statement clarifying it was Saudi-owned and -operated, and not responsible for “what other franchise owners do outside our national borders.” In an Instagram post on Saturday, McDonald's UAE pledged one million AED ($272,000) to the Emirati Red Crescent’s “Tarahum for Gaza” relief campaign, appending a similar statement of local ownership. McDonald's’ operation in Türkiye reportedly donated $1 million to “victims of war” in Gaza, while the franchisee in Kuwait said it contributed $250,000 to the local Red Crescent Society. McDonald’s Israel’s free-meals-to-IDF scheme was “not a global decision, nor was it approved by any of the other local operators, especially those in our region,” the Kuwaiti statement read. On Thursday, McDonald’s Israel boasted on Instagram that it had already provided “tens of thousands of meals” to IDF soldiers, police, and relief workers, and was continuing to deliver thousands daily across the country, on top of a 50% discount for police and military, and five newly-opened restaurants specifically dedicated to serving Israeli security forces. The announcement triggered a significant backlash, as many on social media argued it was cruel to brag about feeding Israelis for free while the Palestinians in Gaza were running dangerously low on food and water under Israel’s punitive blockade. Others rubbished the claims that McDonald’s parent corporation was apolitical, noting it received a percentage of all local subsidiaries’ earnings – including Israel’s. McDonald’s Israel’s social media accounts have since been made private. Pro-Palestinian groups picketed a Lebanese McDonald’s in Saida on Friday in what one local outlet described as an “attack,” before acknowledging no one was hurt or property damaged during the protest. The restaurant’s Lebanese branch subsequently issued a statement affirming its independence."

Earlier this year, China helped broker adeal between Iran and Saudi Arabiato normalise relations after a seven-year diplomatic rift. As a key economic partner of many Middle East countries and buyer of both Saudi and Iranian oil, it seemed Beijing had the economic leverage and goodwill to play a mediator in future conflicts. It even offered to mediate between Israel and Palestine for peace negotiations, and hosted Palestinian Authority PresidentMahmoud Abbasand Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in May on separate visits at the same time. Beijing appeared to be poised to offer itself as a counterpoint to the United States, whose historical baggage in the region and close ties to Israel could get in the way of its role as peacemaker. China, by contrast, has a long policy of non-interference with its diplomatic partners. Less than six months later, Israel’s war on Gaza after the October 7 Hamas attacks on southern Israel is posing a challenge to Beijing’s ambitions as a major player in the Middle East, say analysts. Beijing has interests on both sides of the conflict. It has long advocated for a two-state solution and even armed the Palestinian Liberation Organization in the 1960s and 1970s.  Yet today, Beijing is also Israel’ssecond-largesttrading partner. On Friday,China joined 119 other nationsto vote in support of a non-binding United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a humanitarian truce. Still, for the most part, Beijing has largely stayed on the sidelines of the conflict so far, avoiding the same prominent role it played in bringing about the Saudi-Iran detente. What has China said about the Israel-Hamas war? China has towed a neutral line since the war began and continues to call for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. On October 8, the day after Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, China’s foreign ministry called for a de-escalation in hostilities and for “relevant parties to remain calm, exercise restraint and immediately end the hostilities to protect civilians and avoid further deterioration of the situation”. It also repeated Beijing’s position that the only long-term solution to the conflict is the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Since then, its official comments have been largely the same, with diplomatZhai Juncalling for an “immediate ceasefire and an end to the fighting as quickly as possible” at the Cairo Peace Summit this week. Critics have called China’s position either too “bland” or its response too late – Beijing took a day to issue a formal statement. But Benjamin Ho Tze Ern, an assistant professor at the Singapore-based S Rajaratnam School of International Studies’ China programme, said this was a pragmatic choice. Beijing wanted to “see how other countries respond first so as to proffer it with the moral high ground of taking a more ‘neutral’ approach,”  he said. “Given the fog of war, it does not want to make any clear statements which it may have to retract in the event the information is incorrect.” Why has China stayed neutral? Beijing has remained neutral because such a position is in its long-term regional interest in to not take sides, said Yun Sun, Director of the China programme at the Washington-based Stimson Center. “If China wants to appear as a different great power projecting a different future of reconciliation, it cannot pick one side against the other. That’s why you see statements like China is against all attacks against civilians, which criticise both Hamas and Israel,” she said. The current conflict is also very different from when they negotiated a deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia, a case where both countries wanted a resolution and Oman and Iraq had already laid the groundwork. Hamas and Israel, by contrast, are engaged in a continuing conflict that observers worry could escalate. Beijing may also recognise that in such a protracted conflict that also draws in other powers, it’s simply out of its depth, said Trita Parsi, the co-founder of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. “One has to remember, the Chinese never had the same involvement or knowledge or rapport with different players to be able to play the role that they did play in the Saudi-Iranian equivalent,” he said. “Essentially, they don’t have the same type of luxury of trying to get to know the partners. While you’re mediating this, you need to be way ahead of the game and the Chinese simply are not.” What is at stake for China? China has strong economic interests in the region and those would be affected if the current war draws in other players. It imports a substantial amount of energy from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran. Trade figures are also high at$259bn in 2021for the Middle East and North Africa – three times the volume of US trade with the region. China’s trade with Israel stood at$18bn in 2021. Also at stake is Beijing’s standing on the global stage, said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute. That incentivises China to remain neutral even at risk to its relationship with Israel. “This is about posturing to the Global South, which is largely more sympathetic to the plights of the Palestinians than to the outrage of Israelis. The object for China is to secure support from the Global South to enable it to ‘democratise’ the international order,” Tsang told Al Jazeera by email. “China under Xi is about looking out for its own interest, not in making peace for the global common good,” he said.      How will this affect the US-China rivalry? While SOAS’s Tsang said the current conflict provided another opportunity for China to “push forward an alternative to the US-dominated liberal international order,” Parsi saw it as a chance to show that the two rivals could work together. China’s top diplomat Wang Yi travelled to the US on Thursday to discuss the war with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in another sign that Beijing is still interested in staying involved. Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to travel to San Francisco in November for the APEC Summit, where hemight meet US President Joe Biden. “I think the Chinese see this as a potential opportunity to show the world and show the United States that if China and the United States work together on these issues, better outcomes are achieved for everyone,” Parsi said. “That’s a way for the Chinese to dispel fears on the Western side that the rise of China means that China’s seeking to replace the West.

The massive drill, dubbed Mohammad Rasulullah 2 (Prophet Mohammad 2), kicked off during a ceremony in the southern Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas on Wednesday, with Iran's police chief Brigadier General Ahmad Reza Radan and several military commanders in attendance. The drill involves naval units from the country's southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan as well as the southern provinces of Bushehr and Hormozgan. Commander of the Iranian Border Guards Brigadier General Ahmad Ali Goudarzi explained that the exercise aims to strengthen cooperation and coordination among coast guards, stressing that dozens of marine units, coastal patrol teams and various border guard forces are participating in it. It will also seek to boost the combat capabilities of Iranian border guard forces, and improve security along Iran's maritime borders in the region, he said. Iranian military forces hold routine exercises according to a detailed schedule in various parts of the country in order to test their weaponry and equipment and evaluate their combat preparedness. Iranian officials have repeatedly underscored that the country will not hesitate to strengthen its military capabilities, including its missile power, which are entirely meant for defense, and that Iran's defense capabilities will be never subject to negotiations.

Declaring themselves as a vote bank of over 1 crore votes in a state with just over 3 crore voters, they have not only identified six Assembly constituencies in northern Telangana to fight elections but also decided to have family members and widows of Gulf victims enter the fray by filing over a 100 nominations in Kamareddy Assembly constituency, one of the two seats chosen by Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao to contest this time. The six constituencies are Vemulawada, Korutla, Jagityal, Balkonda, Nirmal, and Sircilla. To this effect, a ‘Dubai-declaration’ was passed by representatives of more than 24 migrants’ rights and welfare unions that gathered in Dubai last week. As a strategy to also draw national attention, this was tried out earlier in the NizamabadLok Sabhapolls of 2019 where turmeric farmers, upset over the non-establishment of the Turmeric Board, filed over 200 nominations in the run-up to the polls that saw then MP Kalvakuntla Kavitha, the chief minister’s daughter, lose the contest toBJP’s Aravind Dharmapuri. Earlier in 1996, Nalgonda Lok Sabha constituency had seen a record 480 nominations as a protest from its fluoride-affected villagers. According to government estimates, there are approximately 15 lakh Telangana workers in the Gulf as well as South Asian countries, in addition to another 25 lakh workers who have returned home over the years. On October 14 and 15, more than 25 organisations based in Telangana and various Gulf countries convened in Dubai and interacted with Gulf migrants over the week. Guggilla Ravi Goud, convenor of the Telangana Gulf Workers Joint Action Committee, an umbrella organisation of 24 unions, toldindianexpress.comthat their demands have been neglected for too long by governments at the Centre and the state. Goud, who has decided to contest the polls from the Vemulawada Assembly constituency, said political parties and governments have done nothing more than offer lip service. He says the state government’s promises to spend an annual budget of Rs 500 crore for Gulf workers, establish a Telangana Gulf Workers Welfare Board, and develop a state NRI policy have remained promises to date. “Nearly 2,000 Telangana people have died in Gulf countries in the last 10 years. There is no ex-gratia. A large number of people are languishing in jails abroad for technical mistakes and our governments do not offer legal or financial assistance. It is terrible that their names are being removed from the ration cards back home due to their non-availability to fulfil KYC needs. Though we are the biggest remitters of foreign money, we do not have schemes for Gulf workers’ families welfare,” he said. Adding to this, Mandha Bheem Reddy, president of Emigrants Welfare Forum, said that since their names are being removed from ration cards, they are unable to avail Arogyasri health scheme or other social security benefits such as Dalit Bandhu or BC Bandu schemes. “These are poor workers who left their families behind to earn a livelihood in a foreign land. DuringCOVID-19repatriation, the government of India charged double the flight charges from them. Unlike other state governments like Maharashtra, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh who offered free quarantine facilities, the Telangana government collected money from these poor people,” Reddy underlined. According to Swadesh Parkipandla, president of Pravasi Mitra Labour Union, the single point agenda of the meeting convened in Dubai was to discuss the state and Centre’s non-serious attitude towards the welfare of migrant workers and hence the need to take the political plunge. “We have the candidates already. We have met with migrant workers in the Gulf and held late-night meetings with them at labour camps over the week. While they would not go back to cast their votes, they would influence and convince their families and friends back home. We will use voice calls, video calls, and social media and whatever we can to put our message across,” Parkipandla said. One of the grouses the workers have against the Centre is regarding the Pravasi Bharatiya Bima Yojana (PMBY) which offers Rs 10 lakh insurance cover towards accidental death or permanent disability leading to loss of employment. “We have been demanding the government to include even natural deaths in this and the insurance should be available to all migrants irrespective of their passport status – ECR (Emigration Check Required) or ECNR (Emigration Check Not Required ). We are ready to pay an increased premium and yet the government does not want to be the facilitator,” added Reddy. Along withTelangana workers from 18 ECR countriessuch as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Yemen, UAE, Malaysia etc, workers associations in countries such as Singapore have joined the cause. Earlier, during the Huzurabad byelections of 2021, a similar plan to field a candidate was floated to put pressure on the government but not put into effect. While Congress MPRahul Gandhiis scheduled to meet with families of Gulf migrants in Telangana on Friday as part of his three-day visit to the state, the leaders say it will not affect their decision to contest the polls."

The commander of U.S. Air Forces Central Command said Wednesday that the decision in July to send F-35 and F-16 fighter jets to the Persian Gulf, along with a naval destroyer and an amphibious assault group that included 2,500 U.S. Marines, seems to have resonated with Iranian officials. ""The increased presence of surface vessels that went in ... combined with our airpower has deterred Iran from taking any actions against maritime shipping,"" Lieutenant General Alexus Grynkewich told members of the Defense Writers Group in Washington. ""It has had good effects,"" he added. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the additional U.S. capabilities to the region after Iran attempted to seize two commercial tankers in international waters off the coast of Oman in early July, which followed Iran's successful seizure of two oil tankers transiting the Strait of Hormuz just months earlier. The U.S. Navy says, in all, Iran has seized or harassed almost 20 ships in the region over the past two years. In contrast, reports from Iran's state-run media on some of the ship seizures have said Iran's actions have been part of efforts to combat illegal fuel smuggling, and they have claimed that at least some of the vessels were in Iran's territorial waters. Still, Grynkewich cautioned Wednesday that Washington's ability to deter Iran from meddling with commercial shipping might be short-lived, especially since the increased U.S. presence is only temporary and some of the forces are slated to head back home. ""I don't know, if they see a change in [U.S.] posture, how they will react,"" he said. The top Air Force general in the Middle East also suggested Tehran's decision to hold back may be part of a larger political calculation. ""It doesn't suit their political ends right now to resort to violence,"" he told reporters. ""Part of that is an Iranian assessment that that would go contrary to kind of their diplomatic outreach initiatives that are ongoing, trying to portray themselves as a responsible partner. ""But there's no doubt in my military mind, at least, that they would resort to that at some point in the future if they saw it as in their interests."" Of particular concern to the United States and its allies in the region is Iran's growing network of militias and proxy forces, spanning Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, which officials say continue to grow in strength and in influence with support from Tehran. U.S. officials say those groups have been stockpiling Iranian-made weaponry, including drones, short-range missiles and an assortment of small arms, for three to four months. Additionally, they see indications that members of the Quds Force within Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have been helping to train, advise and assist the militias and proxy forces so they are better prepared if Iran decides to act. There are also signs that Iranian forces may be getting antsy. Late last month, the U.S. Navy accused Iranian sailors of repeatedly shining a laser at a U.S. helicopter flying through international airspace over the Persian Gulf. And in August, U.S. counterterrorism officials warned that intelligence suggested Iran's own intelligence and security services ""are advancing plotting against the United States, other Western interests and Iranian dissidents more aggressively than they have at any time since the 1980s."" Should Iran decide to again ramp up harassment of commercial ships, however, Air Force Central Command's Grynkewich said U.S. forces would be ready with another show of force. ""The United States is absolutely willing to come back in and surge forces one more time,"" he said.  "

The cutter, working under the command of Combined Task Force (CTF) 150, seized 360 kilograms of methamphetamines, 107 kilograms of heroin and 1,961 kilograms of hashish from the vessel during an interdiction operation. This event marks the second time in a month that CTF 150 has interdicted illicit narcotics at sea. Last month, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Lancaster (F229) seized more than 450 kilograms, or approximately $9.5 million, of illegal drugs including heroin and hashish during a CTF 150 operation in the Arabian Sea. ""This new seizure, the second since the French Navy took command of CTF 150 last July, again shows the commitment of Combined Maritime Forces working together to enhance maritime security in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean,"" said French Navy Capt. Yannick Bossu, commander of CTF 150. CTF 150 is one of five task forces under Combined Maritime Forces, the largest multinational naval partnership in the world. CTF 150 focuses on maritime security operations outside the Arabian Gulf. Since 2021, Combined Maritime Forces has seized more than $1 billion in illegal drugs while patrolling waters across the Middle East. The 38-nation naval partnership upholds the international rules-based order by promoting security and stability across 3.2 million square miles of water encompassing some of the world's most important shipping lanes.

The conflict will“impact global security, escalate regional conflict, jeopardize energy supplies, exacerbate economic crises, and invite further conflicts,”theAssociated Pressquoted al-Sudani as saying on Saturday at a peace summit in Cairo. Al-Sudani called for an immediate ceasefire and a prisoner swap to bring an end to the bloodshed. He argued against bringing civilians out of Gaza amid Israeli bombing, saying,“the Palestinians have no other place but their land.” The prime minister suggested that the crisis could have been averted if UN Security Council resolutions against Israel’s settlement policies in Palestinian territory had been respected. However, Israel dismantled its settlements in Gaza in 2005. Hamas has controlled Gaza since 2006, and no new elections have been held in the territory since then. Al-Sudani’s warning comes amid concerns that Middle East countries could cut off oil exports to the West in response to a potential Israeli ground offensive in Gaza. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian roiled energy markets on Wednesday when he called for Muslim countries to impose an“immediate and complete”oil embargo on Israel. The 1973 Arab oil embargo against the US and other countries that supported Israel led to long lines at gasoline pumps and had a devastating economic impact. However, only about 12% of UScrude importscame from the Middle East in 2022, down from around 85% in the 1970s. International oil markets remain volatile, and the Israel-Hamas war could push prices higher,“which is definitely bad news for inflation,”International Energy Agency executive directorFatih Biroltold AP. Developing countries that rely on imported crude and oil products would be hurt the most, he said. Brent crude, a key international oil benchmark, is currently trading at around $93 per barrel, up from $85 before Hamas militants killed hundreds of Israeli civilians and took hundreds of others as hostages on October 7. Hamas is backed by Iran, which ranks as the world’s eighth-largest oil producer. Even without support from other major exporters for an embargo, Tehran has the potential to significantly disrupt markets. About one-third of the world’s seaborne oil shipments pass through the Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea."

And some decisions are contra this international law,”Borrell said in Oman, where he attended the joint meeting of foreign ministers from the EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Both the EU and the GCC have condemned terrorist attacks by Hamas, Borrell noted, but also condemned any attacks on civilians, demanded the immediate release of all hostages, and called for Israel to respect international law and not block the delivery of food, water or electricity to the civilian population of Gaza. The two blocs have also asked Israel to open“humanitarian corridors”from Gaza to Egypt, so that civilians can leave the territory ahead of Israeli reprisal airstrikes. Borrell’s remarks appeared to be a reference to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’sstatementon Monday ordering a“complete siege”of Gaza. “There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed,”Gallant told the Israeli media.“We are fighting human animals and we act accordingly.” Multiple media outlets alsoquotedGallant as saying on Tuesday that he had“lifted all the restraints”on Israeli rules of engagement against Gaza. Israel launched reprisal airstrikes against the Palestinian territory after Hamas, which controls much of Gaza, sent commandos deep into Israeli territory on Saturday. The three days of heavy clashes have resulted in at least 900 dead Israelis and at least 830 dead Palestinians, according to the authorities in West Jerusalem and Gaza, respectively. Just before Gallant announced the“siege,”the EU declared it would put €691 million ($728.8 million) in aid to the Palestinian Authority under review and suspend all pending payments, citing the“scale of terror and brutality against Israel and its people”by Hamas. Borrell later“clarified”those remarks to note that aid will continue, because suspending it would amount to“punishing all the Palestinian people”and damage EU interests in the region."

In Muscat, the High Representative co-chaired the 27th joint ministerial meeting of the EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council and its member states. Beyond confirming the mutual interest to deepen the already good EU-GCC cooperation, the Joint Council - as agreed by the EU and GCC member states - adopted a Co-Chairs Statement. In this statement, the Joint Council expressed deep concern about the grave developments in Israel and Gaza and condemned all attacks against civilians, reminding the parties of their obligations under the universal principles of International Humanitarian Law. It further called for restraint, the release of hostages and allowing access to food, water and medicines according to International Humanitarian Law. The statement also stressed the urgent need for a political solution to the crisis to avoid repeating this vicious cycle of violence. It called for a halt to all acts of violence and any unilateral measures, and supported the efforts of Saudi Arabia, the European Union and the League of Arab States in cooperation with Egypt and Jordan to revive the Middle East peace process . The EU and the GCC Ministers reiterated their commitment to a two-state solution in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and all relevant UN resolutions. They stressed the importance of sustained financial support for UNRWA, the Palestinian Authority, and for the humanitarian and development needs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In light of the presence of a number of Foreign Ministers of the EU in Muscat, the High Representative convened an emergency meeting of EU Foreign Ministers to address the situation in Israel and in the region. The Ministers endorsed the elements of the EU/GCC statement, reiterated their solidarity with Israel and discussed the EU relationship with the Palestinian Authority. The ministers made a clear distinction between Hamas, a terrorist organization, the Palestinian people and the Palestinian Authority. The overwhelming majority of ministers expressed themselves against the suspension of the payments of EU funds and asked for the continuation of support to the Palestinian people. Ministers also discussed the reaction of Israeli Defence Forces to Hamas' attack and reaffirmed the position of the EU that Israel has the right to defend itself in line with international law, including International Humanitarian Law. Ministers expressed concern over the situation of civilians in Gaza, which was already very dire and is increasingly worsening. There was an overwhelming assessment that the EU should be prepared to support the Palestinian people more in the coming weeks. In the margins of the multilateral meetings in Muscat, the HR/VP held talks with number of partners bilaterally: Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Baidr al Busaidi, as well as the Foreign Ministers of Kuwait, Sheikh Salem Al Sabah, Saudi Arabia, Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud and Bahrain, Abdullatif bin Rashid al Zayani. He also met Qatari Minister of State, Soltan bin Saad Al Muraikhi and UAE State Minister, Reem Al Hashimy.  "

Whether or not Gandhi’s methods are viable in the ongoing humanitarian crisis in that region at present, many of us know that the iconic Indian leader and apostle of peace was interested in what was happening in Palestine in his lifetime. He was opposed to the British policy of“settling”Jews in Palestine against the wishes of those who had lived there. Gandhi wrote back then, “The German persecution of the Jews seems to have no parallel in history (but) my sympathy does not blind me to the requirements of justice. The cry for the national home for the Jews does not make much appeal to me … Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs. What is going on in Palestine today cannot be justiﬁed by any moral code of conduct.” He wrote those sentences in the late 1930s, shortly after Hitler launched his anti-Jew pogroms. For decades, Free India stood by the Palestinians and upheld Gandhi’s views, even after it officially entered into ties with Israel in the early 1990s. Unofficial ties were much older. Interestingly, notwithstanding Gandhi’s views against a national home for the Jews in Palestine, David Ben-Gurion, the founder and the first prime minister of Israel, had in his post-retirement study a portrait of the Mahatma, who did not live long enough to witness the formation of Israel. He was assassinated three months prior – in January 1948. Palestinian scholars are crestfallen by an apparent change of stance by India now that the country’s new rulers are veering towards Israel. To be fair, New Delhi, after initially expressing solidarity with Israel and its “right to exist,” displayed concerns about the sad plight of the Palestinians and dispatchedaidto the besieged people via Egypt. It is obvious that the country is dexterously performing the tight-rope-balancing act in the Middle East. It needs to, for multiple reasons. Firstly, nurturing closer ties with Israel, a country known for its startup, hi-tech, and military prowess, brings in advantages at a time when the country is growing as an economy and an important geopolitical player. Israel had supplied India with weaponry in crucial moments such as the Kargil War of 1999 and later helped equip it on the surveillance front. India-Israel trade has grown from $200 million in 1992 to $4.5 billion in 2014. It was destined to grow further. In the 2023 fiscal year, Indian merchandise exports to Israel were valued at $7.89 billion and Israeli exports to India were at $2.13 billion. Besides,bilateral tradein services stood at $1.1 billion as of 2021, according to the latest data available. Indian tech companies and others are steadily investing in Israel. Similarly, Israel has made many investments in India, primarily in technology, agriculture, and water. Most importantly, a consortium led by India’s Adani Group and a local partner owns the strategic Haifa port in Israel. One-third of the consortium’s shares are with the Israeli partner Gadot, while the other two-thirds are owned by the Adani Group. Israel and Haifa port are central to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC), the ambitious multi-billion connectivity scheme linking India and Europe. The multi-modal transport corridor, conceived by G-7 countries as a counterweight to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), envisages linking India’s west coast via the UAE through the Arabian Peninsula to the Haifa port, from where goods will head for Greece and other European destinations. In short, although the Israel-Hamas clash has put the IMEEC project, which requires cooperation from Arab countries, hanging, Israel is far more pivotal to India’s ambitions now than ever before. The Gulf countries, for whom the Palestinian issue is a sensitive topic, are also vital for India. Close to 9 million non-resident Indians (NRIs) live in them, according to official government statistics.The PTInews agency reports that, as of March 2022, Gulf countries account for more than 66 percent of NRIs – out of around 13.4 million NRIs around the world. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) employs more than 3.41 million Indians, Saudi Arabia 2.59 million, Kuwait 1.02 million, Qatar 740,000, Oman 770,000, Bahrain 320,000, and so on. Far fewer Indian citizens are based in the US and the UK. On the other hand, only20,000 Indianscurrently reside in Israel, according to Israel's Consul General in Mumbai, Kobbi Shoshani. A survey of remittancesfrom abroad reveals more about the India-Arab world connection. The US is the single highest source of remittances to India – which refers to the money that Indians abroad send to their own accounts or to their relatives back home in the country. But, as a group, the Gulf countries contribute much more, with UAE topping the list. The United States accounted for remittances of $23.4 million, the United Arab Emirates $18 million, the United Kingdom $6.8 million, Singapore $5.7 million, Saudi Arabia $5.1 million, Kuwait $2.4 million, Oman $1.6 million, Qatar $1.5 million, and so on. New Delhi is also gung-ho about potential tie-ups with Saudi Arabia, which is planning a huge image makeover, including the building of new smart cities, to attract international investment. Indian businessmen have publicly talked about their excitement to invest in that country. For India, it is all the more essential in the wake of its growing tensions with China to win more friends in the Arab world and Africa, besides the West, to retain its stature on the global stage and secure itself against tectonic shifts in world power. Which is why the foreign establishment has been cautious about the way the crisis is being handled. There is, however, a worrying aspect about certain preoccupations that have crept in. It is obvious that, increasingly, at a cultural and political level at least, there is greater stress on the medieval period of India than the modern one, which saw Great Britain colonizing the subcontinent. That such a propensity is influencing our political priorities at home is a foregone conclusion. Not letting such internal politicking enter geopolitical concerns is crucial in not only gaining friends but also retaining them. In that sense, Gandhi is as relevant as ever in the way he foresaw how dangerous digging up myths and ancient pieces of history to justify modern political projects can get. That must be the premise from which to operate: having empathy for the lived experiences of others without bias. As Gandhi warned us, doing justice to one group of people cannot come at a cost to another."

Speaking to students in Tehran on Wednesday, Khamenei said,“What Islamic governments must insist on is the immediate cessation of crimes in Gaza,”suggesting that Muslim countries should“block the export of oil and food to the Zionist regime,”as quoted by the state-run IRNA media outlet. He went on to claim that Israel is“now in a state of shock and desperation and does not know what to do,”while pointing out that the events in Gaza have prompted people to take to the streets and denounce Israel’s actions, not only in Muslim-majority states, but also in the US and Western Europe. In mid-October, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, had made a similar call, asking Muslim nations to impose an“immediate and complete”oil embargo on Israel Last week, Libya’s House of Representatives (HoR, Majlis al-Nuwaab), which is located in the eastern city of Tobruk, controlled by General Khalifa Haftar, also demanded that the government halt oil and gas exports to countries supporting Israel if the“Israeli massacres”do not cease. The lawmakers also called for the expulsion from Libya of the ambassadors of the countries that back Israel. It is worth noting that the Tobruk-based authorities do not control the whole of Libya, with a rival government operating from Tripoli. Also last month, the Associated Press quoted Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani as warning that supplies of Middle Eastern oil to international markets could potentially be disrupted if other nations join the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Iran, aside from being the world’s eighth-largest oil producer, could also potentially block the narrow Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. The route is used to transport approximately one-third of the world’s seaborne oil shipments. Back in 1973, an oil embargo imposed on the US and Western countries by Arab nations in response to their support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War led to a severe deficit and an ensuing economic slump."

For the second time in two years, the Biden Administration has effectively snubbed the U.S. Coast Guard, shutting the under-funded and overtasked maritime law enforcement agency out of a wide-ranging supplemental funding instrument. Last week, the Office of Management and Budget put forward an enormous, $100 billion emergency supplemental funding request, asking Congress to boost U.S. security efforts in Ukraine as well as the Middle East, the Pacific and at the border—all places where the U.S. Coast Guard is hard at work. But the Coast Guard, operating from a modest $13 billion budget, got nothing. America’s second Navy was ignored. Other agencies got far better treatment. If the emergency supplemental stands, competing agency-level components of the Department of Homeland Security—the Coast Guard’s partner agencies— will get giant funding plus-ups. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is set to receive an extra $5.3 billion, a giant 27% bump over the organization’s 19.5 billion 2024 budget request. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement may get $2.5 billion, 28.7% more than the Administration’s original 8.7 billion 2024 budget proposal. It is an embarrassment for the Coast Guard. In total, the Office of Management and Budget is seeking $13.6 billion for a “Border Supplemental Request”, and yet, the Coast Guard was left entirely out. Emergency funding requests are capricious things, often benefiting those agencies that are wired into the bureaucracy and have large, easy-to-understand wish lists. But, after getting left behind in late 2021, when the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act granted U.S. Customs and Border Protection a massive $3.7 billion windfall in the face of the Coast Guard’s measly $434 million add-on, the Coast Guard needs to start figuring out if they have an advocacy problem—or if somebody in Biden’s Administration or the OMB staff hates the chronically-underfunded maritime-oriented organization. DC budget battles are not the Coast Guard’s natural environment. But the Federal budget process is a zero-sum game, and everybody knows that the always-helpful and always collaborative Coast Guard struggles to engage in internecine knife fights over money. But the Coast Guard—doing all it can to secure the border, the Pacific and the Middle East—also needs to learn how to fight for their fair share of the taxpayer dollar. It’s all part of the job. Coast Guard intercepts drugs in the Gulf of Oman Terrible Timing For A Snub As the Chinese Coast Guard made headlines for hitting a Philippine vessel and blockading a Philippine outpost in the South China Sea, the U.S. Coast Guard, with little fanfare, was quietly chalking up another “first” in the Pacific, completing a low-profile, four-day visit to the Philippine port of Tacloban. Rather than celebrate with an international and multi-agency public relations effort, the U.S. Coast Guard’s audacious diplomatic coup barely rated a mention on the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service. That was no mistake. It’s Bureaucracy 101: When robbing Coast Guard funding, it is poor form to point out how much the Coast Guard does with so little. But both the State Department and the Defense Department might do well to advocate a bit more for America’s maritime law enforcement agency. The Coast Guard is fighting on all fronts and doing great work in supporting both agencies. In the Pacific, over the past month, Coast Guard diplomats signed a bilateral law enforcement agreement with the Republic of Palau. Families welcomed the National Security Cutter USCGC Munro (WMSL 755) home from a 118-day, 23,000 mile Western Pacific patrol. The cutter did a lot while on patrol. It drew diplomatic protests from Beijing after passing through the Taiwan Straits and built more Chinese ire as the ship visited five strategic partners and worked with two more. America’s little law enforcement navy is becoming the diplomatic “partner of choice” in the Pacific. The Coast Guard’s efforts are paying off. In the eastern Pacific, Coast Guard assets supported Southern Shield, conducting their first high-seas boardings of fishing vessels off the coast of Peru, employing an under-appreciated victory in maritime diplomacy to push back on China’s globe-spanning and predatory illegal fishing fleet. In the Middle East, the Coast Guard is also on the front lines, securing Americas critical petrochemical trade routes. With new Fast Response Cutters, the Coast Guard is stopping smugglers, engaging in the dangerous business of exploring how the Iranian-linked Hezbollah terror group might be raising money via drug smuggling operations. In May, USCGC Glen Harris (WPC 1144), one of 6 forward-deployed U.S. Coast Guard cutters operating in the Persian Gulf—almost 10 percent of the Coast Guard’s planned Sentinel-class cutter fleet—intercepted Iranian smugglers, seizing $110 million in heroin and methamphetamine in a single week. On America’s maritime borders, migrants are also stressing the Coast Guard. In FY 2022 alone, the known flow of seaborne migrants increased by 44%. Migrants are choosing the maritime in increasing numbers, with maritime migrant interceptions more than doubling. In April, halfway through the fiscal year, the Coast Guard had already intercepted some 6,202 Cubans in contrast to interdicting 6,182 Cubans over the twelve months of the previous fiscal year. Migration from Haiti and the Dominican Republic is increasing by similar levels, but the Coast Guard rarely discusses the substantial operational challenges posed by the ongoing uptick in maritime migrants. Put bluntly, the Coast Guard is doing an awful lot for very little. Despite hiccups, the Coast Guard desperately needs funding. The Coast Guard can certainly use extra operational and maintenance money, stations need refurbishing across the service, and sailors desperately need small-cutter tenders support forward engagement and to prepare for a wave of high-risk anti-smuggling, sea control and migrant interdiction operations from the Persian Gulf to the Caribbean and beyond. The sad thing is that it doesn’t take much to make the Coast Guard happy, and, by now, both Congress and the Administration should know that the Coast Guard can do far more for the country with $434 million than U.S. Customs and Border Protection will ever do with $3.7 billion. With a little bit of cash, America’s maritime law enforcement agency can make miracles happen, pulling lost and hapless mariners from almost certain death at sea. But it cannot make something out of nothing. And nothing is exactly what the Coast Guard is getting from the Administration’s supplemental emergency funding request."

The informal agreement, according to these anonymous sources, encompassed freezing Iranian uranium enrichment at 60% and permitting the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to install cameras at several nuclear sites. On the other hand, the US’ concessions included disregarding Iranian oil sales – in essence, refraining from enforcing sanctions – and allowing all Iranian assets to be released, reportedly amounting to roughly $20 billion. This is well over the widely reported $6 billion touted in the international press. What makes this agreement so intriguing is that it was non-formal, including no known signed documents, and was contrived over several months and under the auspices of Qatar and Oman as intermediaries. From leaked information, citing unnamed sources, what we can gather – regardless of what claims are true or false – is that the prisoner swap was more than a simple exchange of prisoners and $6 billion in frozen assets. According toa report released in Mayby Axios, secret indirect talks between the US and Iran had been conducted in Oman, which three sources close to the news outlet claimed Iran’s top nuclear negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kan, was part of. Later, in June,the New York Times released a reportclaiming that secret negotiations were going on, aimed at concluding an informal agreement to replace the need to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. To begin with, if we are to assume that the official US narrative on the agreement is correct, despite Iranian officials having contradicted it, then the most apparent objective in mind from Washington’s perspective would be to cause a thaw in America’s relationship with the Islamic Republic. As various analysts have suggested, this could have also signaled hope for a revival of the nuclear deal, which fell apart after the administration of former President Donald Trumpunilaterally withdrew from it in 2018. Hope had largely faded that the administration of President Joe Biden could bring the deal back to life after Biden was revealed to have said that it was officially “dead” in November of 2022. However, given the information we have at hand, what is most likely here is that this represents a massive de-escalation following ship seizures and the beefing up of America’s troop presence in the Persian Gulf back in August. Why a de-escalation now? Is it to revive nuclear deal talks? This appears highly unlikely. Instead, the prisoner exchange agreement comes simultaneously with, and is somewhat overshadowed by, developments in the ongoing discussions to reach an American-brokered normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The two nations, both powerful partners of the US in the Middle East, have never had formal diplomatic relations with each other. Saudi Arabia does not recognize Israel as a sovereign country and has been at loggerheads with it over its treatment of Arabs in Palestine, which Riyadh ostensibly wants to see as an independent nation. Negotiations to finally normalize diplomatic relations have been ongoing for months now, with the US being a highly invested middleman, given that achieving such a deal would help consolidate its power base in the region. As for Iran, while Israel sees it as an existential enemy, Saudi Arabia has had a complicated relationship with it, only having re-established diplomatic ties earlier this year in a deal brokered by China. When Biden met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)’s 78th session, they publicly discussed the high hopes of concluding Saudi-Israeli normalization. This was followed by two Fox News interviews, one with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and the other with the Israeli PM, during which both said that the deal grows closer by the day. At Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to the UNGA, he spoke at length on Iran; however, there was no mention of the recent US-Iranian prisoner exchange. In fact, Israel has remained silent on the informal deal. This is especially interesting, considering that Tel Aviv* routinely attacks the prospect of any agreement with Iran, let alone one that allows for tens of billions in funds to be transferred back into the hands of Tehran. In June,Netanyahu spoke over the phone with US Secretary of StateAntony Blinken, during which he discussed Iran at length and proclaimed that he opposes and will not be bound by any agreement struck between Washington and Tehran. On September 5, Antony Blinkenspoke with the Israeli premier again, allegedly discussing Iran as the primary subject of the call. While the precise details of the calls are impossible to apprehend, there had to be a good chance that the prisoner swap agreement was mentioned, as reports had publicly been leaked to the press regarding Iran-US talks. With so much focus placed upon Iran by Israel, it makes no sense that Tel Aviv would remain silent on the prisoner exchange, especially given the release of Iran’s formerly frozen funds. Not silent on the unfreezing of Tehran’s billions were Republican politicians in the US Congress. If the Biden administration were to have accepted a renewal of the 2015 nuclear deal, one of its major hurdles would have been passing the deal in Congress, including the deeply opposed Republican-led House of Representatives. In fact, any attempt to try and pass a deal, at this point, could reflect negatively on the Biden White House, which matters more now as we head towards the 2024 presidential election. Therefore, by striking an informal agreement with Tehran, the US de-escalates and addresses some of its worries surrounding Iran’s nuclear program. More importantly, however, the US government could be trying to create a fertile environment for the conclusion of an Israeli-Saudi normalization agreement, both by calming Iran down to de-escalate regional tensions and, possibly, leveraging concessions to ease Tehran’s pushback against the normalization directly. Whether this strategy will work or not is yet to be seen. Still, it is clear that the key foreign policy goal for Joe Biden is securing the normalization agreement, which is why it makes sense that the most powerful nation that opposes it – Iran – should be addressed and taken seriously. *Russia recognizes West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,as shownon the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Consular Department website"

The move comes amid fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants, which has claimed thousands of lives this month. Led by the elite 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, the“rapid response force”is headed toward Israel on board the USS Bataan, an amphibious assault ship previously stationed in the Gulf of Oman, officials told the outlet on Monday. They did not specify the unit’s exact destination, or say if it would join two US carrier strike groups presently in the Eastern Mediterranean. The naval deployments are reportedly meant to“send a message of deterrence to Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah,”and some of the US warships have recently patrolled waters near the Islamic Republic. Separately, on Sunday Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered another 2,000 troops to gear up for a potential“medical and logistical support”mission in Israel, according to multiple news agencies. However, Pentagon staffers stressed that the order does not guarantee direct US involvement in the conflict with the Gaza-based militant group Hamas, noting that the White House“does not want to give the impression that American troops could become embroiled in a hot war.” The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the preparations, also stated that the troops would be tasked with“advising and medical support”and“aren't intended to serve in a combat role.” The 2,000 soldiers are now stationed across a wide area, including in the Middle East and Europe, but have been placed on notice to deploy within 24 hours if needed. Though officials said the move would be aimed at“forestalling a wider regional war,”the planning comes as some US lawmakers push for direct military action in the Middle East. During a sit-down with CNN last week, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham declared:“If there's an escalation of this war against Israel, I'm blaming Iran, and it is now time to put them on notice.” Asked whether Washington should“bomb Iran,”even without evidence the country aided Hamas’ deadly October 7 terrorist attack on Israel, Graham simply replied:“Yeah.” The surprise rocket and ground assault from Gaza on Israeli cities has triggered weeks of fighting, with the Israel Defense Forces launching retaliatory airstrikes on the Palestinian enclave. Around 1,400 people have been killed in Israel in the latest flare-up, according to local authorities, while Palestinian officials have reported over 2,800 fatalities in Gaza."

The initiative was first introduced in 2022 and was embraced by OCI's workforce thanks to Prysmian Group support. The continuation of the program highlights the relevance of OCI within Prysmian Group and OCI's ongoing commitment to recognizing its employees' dedication, while encouraging a proactive part in the company's success. Fabrizio Rutschmann, Prysmian Group Chief HR Officer commented: ""We firmly believe that when employees become shareholders, their level of engagement is higher as they feel more part of their company mission. Looking ahead, this is one way to get more motivated employees which is fundamental to achieve more ambitious results. Moreover, the best companies work to generate value4all: shareholders, employees and stakeholders, like the local communities in which we operate. Through these programs we aim to generate more value and share it also with our people"". Under the leadership of OCI's CEO, Cinzia Farisè, this rewarding program works by aligning the goals of employees with the success of the company, encouraging a sense of ownership, motivation and teamwork. Eligible employees will receive a portion of the company's profits based on predetermined criteria. Cinzia Farisè, CEO of Oman Cables Industry, said: ""Building on the successful and positive feedback we received from last year's profit-sharing program, and with the endorsement of OCI's board, we are delighted to relaunch this fulfilling initiative. The program aligns with our company's good performance while recognizing and rewarding the individual achievements of our dedicated workforce. The reward system is designed to incentivize employees to reach annual targets, which helps to ensure both the company's growth and individual development. This initiative also aligns with the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) approach, reflecting OCI's commitment to retaining and empowering its workforce."". OCI's profit-sharing initiative caters to its diverse workforce and rewards employees across various roles, including those working in desk and non-desk roles. This inclusivity reflects OCI's commitment to encouraging a diverse and inclusive environment where every employee feels valued and plays an active part in the company's journey to success. OCI introduced an inclusive share ownership plan in 2022, enabling employees to become shareholders of Prysmian Group. This development marked a proud moment for OCI as its workers were offered the chance to have a vested interest in the company's future. As part of OCI's vision, the company is contributing to Prysmian Group's Social Ambition 2030 and strives to achieve 50% employee ownership within the organization. This vision is brought to life through OCI's stock ownership plan, which enables eligible employees to convert all or part of their bonus into company shares. In the evolving landscape of today's corporate culture, OCI remains committed to empowering its workforce. The profit-sharing initiative highlights the company's dedication to innovation, employee engagement and sustained success. -ends- About Oman Cables Industry (SAOG):Oman Cables Industry (SAOG) is a leading cable manufacturer based in the Sultanate of Oman.

The parties stressed the need to take urgent measures to achieve an early ceasefire and to open humanitarian corridors, which will help avoid new casualties and provide practical assistance to civilians affected by the hostilities. They also called on all interested parties to consolidate their efforts to create conditions conducive to a negotiation process between Palestine and Israel on all final status issues, which should result in the creation of an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 borders to coexist in peace and security with Israel. Sergey Lavrov and Sayyid Badr bin Hamad Albusaidi also exchanged views on a number of other international issues and touched on several aspects of further strengthening multifaceted Russian-Omani ties, including maintaining an active political dialogue.

And no, not because of a popular movie that came out last summer, but because of a global effort to raise awareness of breast cancer and how to navigate prevention and early detection. This year, in partnership with the Oman Cancer Association (OCA) and Muscat Grand Mall, Ooredoo is supporting Breast Cancer Awareness Month with a campaign allowing women in Oman over the age of 40 to be screened free of charge. Through this campaign, Ooredoo aims to underline the importance of regular check-ups and that early detection matters. Ooredoo is committed to being a company with a purpose beyond profit. They are advocates of women's empowerment and enablement as well as caring, and stress the importance of not putting off regular health screenings because of cost, fear, or just because they are too busy being their family's caretakers. Breast cancer prevention and early detection, which includes self-exams, regular clinical exams and mammograms are important and can save lives. Indeed, experts have confirmed that early detection when something is still tiny gives the very best chance of successful treatment. The free screening took place in a Mobile Mammography Unit at Muscat Grand Mall, with the first day being for Ooredoo staff and the second day for members of the public. Mammogram tests take just 20 minutes and Ooredoo is now encouraging women countrywide over the age of 40 to get tested regularly.

With Israel at war with Hamas, the Senate is moving urgently to fill key U.S. diplomatic posts throughout the Middle East — many of which have been sitting empty for months. Most glaringly, the U.S. does not currently have an ambassador in Israel. That vacancy hobbles the Biden administration's ability to pursue a number of goals, from negotiating the release of U.S. hostages held by Hamas to easing the violence and preventing it from blossoming into a wider conflict. It is ""unprecedented"" to have so many U.S. ambassador posts sit vacant for as long as they have this year, Farah Pandith, an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told NPR. ""We're in the midst of an extremely dangerous moment in the Middle East and the value of having a U.S. ambassador on the ground in Israel can't be overstated,"" Pandith said. ""It is critical in both the short term and over the longer term."" It's the second recent war to break out in a country without a U.S. ambassador. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the top U.S. diplomatic postwas also empty. Jack Lew, President Biden's nominee to be the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, arrives for a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.Drew Angerer/Getty Imageshide caption Jack Lew, President Biden's nominee to be the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, arrives for a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing for Jack Lew, President Biden's nominee to the Israel post, on Wednesday — just one month after Lew was nominated. It's expected to hold a vote next week. If approved, Lew's nomination heads to the full Senate for confirmation. Lew was Treasury Secretary under President Barack Obama. He has also held numerous White House jobs and is a former director of the Office of Management and Budget. But Republicans on the panel criticized Lew, because he worked on the controversialIran nuclear dealin 2015. Lew, who is Jewish, told the panel he sees Iran as an""evil, malign government""and a threat to Israel. Lew's relatively rapid advance is paralleledelsewhere. This week, the Senate also confirmed new ambassadors to Kuwait and Oman, and the foreign relations panel is holding a hearing for Biden's pick to represent the U.S. in Egypt. Some important ambassadorial posts in the region, such as in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, were filled earlier in 2023 after sitting empty for nearly a year. Even before the shocking Hamas attack on Oct. 7, U.S. diplomatic corps in Israel were very busy. The U.S had two main goals: trying to convince Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to temper his plans to weaken the judiciary; and reaching an agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations. ""We have diplomats for a reason,"" Pandith said. She later added, ""American foreign policy starts in Washington, but the leadership on the ground helps to see it through."" Before Hamas militants launched their surprise attack, at least five U.S. ambassador posts were sitting vacant in the Arabic world, according to theAmerican Foreign Service Association. ""Many of these countries are key regional actors who could be leveraged to advance U.S. interests in resolving the current round of fighting,"" Pandith said. ""For example, Egypt shares a border with Gaza and Oman is a trusted intermediary between the United States and Iran."" Israel:Vacant. Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Tom Nidesannounced his resignation in May, after less than two years in the job. Last month, Bidenselected Jack Lewto fill the post. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on Lew's nomination on Wednesday. Egypt:Vacant. The nomination of Herro Mustafa Garg — a former ambassador to Bulgaria who speaks Arabic, Kurdish, Farsi, and several other languages — has been pending since late March. The Senate committee held ahearing for her nomination on Thursday. Oman:Filled, Oct. 17. Ana Escrogima was confirmed after her nominationlanguishedfor four months despite a favorable committee report. The delay was apparently due toholds placed in the Senate; senators can block nominations privately. Kuwait:Filled, Oct. 16. The Senate confirmed Karen Sasahara — who once served as America'sde facto ambassador to the Palestiniansin Jerusalem — to the Kuwait post nine months after Biden nominated her on Jan. 3. Jordan:Filled. Yael Lempert was sworn in as the new U.S. ambassador to Jordan on Aug. 9. Like Sasahara, she was nominated on Jan. 3. Lebanon:In flux. Lisa A. Johnson was nominated in February. She would replace Ambassador Dorothy C. Shea, who is nominated to be the U.S. deputy representative in the U.N. The foreign relations panel advanced both of their nominations to the full Senate this summer. Vacant ambassador posts do more than limit a country's ability to pursue strategic and foreign policy goals; the empty posts also send a message. ""We are promoting the view that what is happening there is not important to us,"" and the U.S. doesn't have interests in the Middle East, Pandith said. ""The irony is that China has also taken to filling the diplomatic void we've left in the region,"" she said, ""the most notable example being this spring when it brokered an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, notorious historical foes."" Most of the delays have nothing to do with the candidates, many of whom are career diplomats. Senators can place a block on their nominations to gain leverage for their own political aims — such as when Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blocked all State Department nominees earlier this year in his fight for records related to theorigins of COVID-19. When Paul lifted his block in July, the Senateconfirmed 15 ambassadorsin one day. Such delays are a sign of how the confirmation process has become increasingly politicized. Four years ago, the U.S. diplomatic corps also haddozens of vacancies— but nearly all of the longest-delayed nominations were for political appointees, not career diplomats. As of this week, 13 nominations from 2022 are still pending, and nearly all of them are for career diplomats."

""Under the current circumstances, the [Palestinian] people in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank need support of Muslim countries more than ever,"" Amir-Abdollahian said in a phone call with Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi on Monday. He added that Iran and Oman have always supported the Palestinian people in the face of the Israeli enemy. Pointing to Israel's crimes against the Palestinian people, the top Iranian diplomat said the regime killed 260 Palestinians, including 40 children and 11 women, in recent months. He added that the Israeli regime has also arrested more Palestinians in the West Bank as the number of Palestinian prisoners has reached nearly 5,000, about 200 of whom are women and children. Amir-Abdollahian emphasized that the Tel Aviv regime also escalated its attacks on al-Aqsa Mosque and carried out more sacrilegious acts against it. The ongoing massive military operation by the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas was a response to Israel's measures, he pointed out. The Iranian foreign minister said that in separate phone calls with a number of his counterparts from Muslim countries, he called for an immediate emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to discuss the Palestinian issue. Since early Saturday, the large-scale multi-pronged operation has featured heavy rocket barrages and surprise attacks by resistance fighters against Israeli forces and settlers in the occupied territories. Palestinian resistance leaders have described the operation as a decisive answer to the regime's unabated campaign of bloodshed and destruction against Palestinians. The resistance groups in the besieged Gaza Strip have since the launch of Operation Al-Aqsa Storm fired more than 5,000 rockets at the occupied territories, with Israeli media outlets saying more than 800 settlers and troops have been killed and over 2,400 others injured. For his part, Albusaidi said Oman like other countries in the region and the world expresses its sympathy with the Palestinian people over the killing of hundreds of innocent civilians. The Omani foreign minister added that the international community must recognize the Palestinian people's right to determine their own fate and liberate the occupied territories.  "

To target the Hamas investment portfolio, a US official said Tuesday the Treasury Department is working with members of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Following the Hamas terror attacks on Israel, US and Saudi officials convened an emergency meeting on Tuesday in Riyadh of the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, which includes the United States and the GCC nations. The meeting was originally scheduled to take place in November. The US official said there has been a redoubling of efforts since Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israelto use the TFTC, which was created in 2017, to go after Hamas, Hezbollah and other Iranian-aligned militant groups, including by sharing relevant, timely and actionable information. Last week,Treasury leveled sanctionson individuals that officials say aremanaging assets in a “secret” Hamas investment portfoliolikely valued at between $400 million and $1 billion, according to a US official. The official added that the portfolio is generating significant amounts of revenue for Hamas. 'They're opportunistic and adaptive': How Hamas is using cryptocurrency to raise funds Treasury has said the global portfolio of investments includes companies operating “under the guise of legitimate businesses” in Sudan, Algeria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other nations. “We cannot tolerate a world in which Hamas and other terrorist organizations’ fundraisers live and operate with impunity, abusing the financial system, to sustain their terror.” Brian Nelson, Treasury’s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said during prepared remarks at the emergency TFTC meeting. Nelson urged the Gulf nations to share more information on the parts of the Hamas financial ecosystem “vulnerable to disruption” and called on member countries to take action. “From our perspective, not acting against Hamas and its terrorism is a disservice to the Palestinian people,” Nelson said. “From a financial standpoint, we can clearly see that Hamas has exacerbated economic hardships for decades in the Gaza strip by diverting humanitarian assistance to support its campaign of terror, and we must publicly condemn these actions.” A UAE official told CNN on Wednesday the Gulf nation supports global efforts to fight money laundering and terror financing. “The UAE is committed to combatting illegal financial activities such as money laundering and financing of terrorism,” the official said in a statement. “The country’s policies and strategies detect and deter financial crimes and prevent the use of its lands as a transit route or to transfer funds resulting from any criminal activity.” In another step aimed at disrupting Hamas funding, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo plans to travel to Europe on Friday, the Treasury Department announced. Adeyemo plans to work with partners in Europe to “deny Hamas and other terrorist organizations the ability to raise and use funds.” Last week, Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network laid out new rules taking aim at the ability of Hamas and other terror groups touse cryptocurrencies for fundraising.FinCEN proposeddesignating foreign cryptocurrency “mixers” – platforms that make digital funds harder to track – as money laundering and national security risks."

Two defense officials familiar with the planning said the rapid response force, consisting of 2,000 Marines and sailors, is being sent. It will join a growing number of US warships and forces converging on Israel as the US seeks to send a message of deterrence to Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. On Sunday evening, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordered that roughly 2,000 troops prepare for a potential deployment to Israel to help with tasks like medical and logistical support, multiple defense officials said. Taken together, the moves are aimed at forestalling a wider regional war, officials said. But they also risk deepening the US’ involvement in a conflict in which the Biden administration istrying to avoid direct militaryaction. US sending second carrier strike group, fighter jets to region as Israel prepares to expand Gaza operations Officials have stressed that the US has no plans to put American boots on the ground to fight in the war between Israel and Hamas, which Israeli officials have warned could be prolonged and difficult. But the planning and movements offer a window into the kind of assistance the US might provide, including managing logistics away from the front lines and offering medical support. That could be particularly valuable if Israel launches a ground invasion of Gaza, which could be complicated and bloody, experts have warned. The decisions also come as the US military has been steadily bolstering its presence in Middle East, including deploying a second aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean Sea to join the USS Ford strike carrier group there, and sending Air Force fighter jets to the region. The Pentagon has been deliberately cautious about how it discusses any potential deployment of US troops to Israel, officials said, because the Biden administration does not want to give the impression that American troops could become embroiled in a hot war. But there are preparations underway for a range of contingencies should things devolve further. The 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), which specializes in tasks such as amphibious operations, crisis response, humanitarian assistance, and certain special operations, had been stationed near Kuwait in recent weeks as part of a scheduled exercise there. But it departed early “as a result of emerging events,” Capt. Angelica White, a spokeswoman for the unit, told the Marine Corps Times on Wednesday. CNN previously reported that the unit was preparing for a possible move toward Israel. Officials would not specify where exactly the Marine unit will now go, other than to say it is headed toward Israel. One official said it will head for the southern coast of Israel, which would put US forces near the country’s two coastlines. The unit is on board the USS Bataan, an amphibious assault ship which is currently in the Gulf of Oman, officials said. The USS Carter Hall, a dock landing ship that is operating with the USS Bataan, is also sailing toward Israel. The US is mounting a frantic effort to head off a wider Middle East war The USS Bataan and the 26th MEU have been operating in the Middle East since August as part of an effort to deter Iranian aggression in the critical waterways around of the region, including the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz. Austin’s order to prepare troops for a possible deployment, meanwhile, does not mean they will definitely deploy, or that any will serve in a combat role if they do go to Israel, officials said. But the secretary’s decision has shortened the time the identified troops will have to prepare for the mission if they are ordered to go, officials said. The Wall Street Journal wasfirst to reportabout the potential deployment of troops to Israel. Asked about the possible movement, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said on Monday, “I don’t have more to provide at this time. I might be able to give you more details later, but at this time I just don’t have anything more specific to add to.” If the decision is made to deploy the troops to Israel in a support role, retired Maj. Gen. James “Spider” Marks, a military analyst for CNN, said it would likely include several elements to best assist Israeli forces. Part of the deployment would likely be a command-and-control element for material management to help with supplies, such as food, fuel, construction materials and more. It would also likely entail a joint munitions unit to help with the flow of ammunition, as well as a liaison capability from the Defense Logistics Agency that can help the Israeli military with weapons purchases and other critical moves. This story has been updated with additional details."

Tommy Tuberville’songoing hold on military confirmationsis impacting a number of senior military appointments in the Middle East, as the Pentagon moves to bolster its presence in the region amid the ongoing crisis in Israel. And Tuberville is still not relenting, according to a spokesperson – not until the Pentagon revokes its policy of reimbursing service members for health care-related travel, which the senator has argued facilitates abortions. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced on Sunday that he has ordered the US Navy’s Ford carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, near Israel. The USS Gerald Ford is the Navy’s most advanced aircraft carrier and it is being deployed to the area, along with a guided missile cruiser and four destroyers, as a deterrence measure, Austin said. But Tuberville’s blockade means that the current commander of the US Navy’s 5th fleet – which is responsible for US naval operations in the Middle East region including the Red Sea and Gulf of Oman – is still awaiting promotion to deputy commander of US Central Command, which oversees US forces and operations in the region. The deputy commanders of both 5th fleet and US Air Forces Central are also included in Tuberville’s hold, as well as CENTCOM’s deputy director of strategy, plans and policy. Last month, after a procedural threat from Tuberville, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer moved to have three key military promotions – the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Marine Corps commandant and the Army chief of staff – voted on separately rather than as part of a bloc of holds by Tuberville. All three have since been confirmed, but Admiral Lisa Franchetti, nominated to serve as the chief of Naval Operations, is still awaiting confirmation and has been leading the service on an acting basis. Pentagon leadership roles have had to be significantly reshuffled because of Tuberville’s hold. Many senior military officers are performing two jobs as they await promotion, and some key positions are being held by more junior officers because a more senior officer has not yet been confirmed by the Senate."

Indian authorities said they were ""deeply shocked"" after the eight Indians, held on undeclared charges since August 2022, were given the death sentence Thursday by Qatar's Court of First Instance. ""It is most unlikely that the eight will be executed,"" foreign affairs expert K P Fabian, who served as ambassador of Qatar in the past, toldInternational Business Times. The eight former naval personnel — seven officers and one sailor — were reportedly accused ofespionagein connection with a submarine program. At the time of their arrest on Aug. 30, 2022, they were working for Al Dahra Global Technologies and Consultancy Services, a private firm owned by an Oman Air Force officer that provided training and other services to Qatar's armed forces and security agencies. ""We have initial information that the Court of First Instance of Qatar has today passed a judgment in the case involving eight Indian employees of Al Dahra company,"" India's Ministry of External Affairs said in a Thursdaystatement. ""We are deeply shocked by the verdict of death penalty and are awaiting the detailed judgement. We are in touch with the family members and the legal team, and we are exploring all legal options."" ""We attach high importance to this case, and have been following it closely. We will continue to extend all consular and legal assistance. We will also take up the verdict with Qatari authorities,"" it added. ""Due to the confidential nature of proceedings of this case, it would not be appropriate to make any further comment at this juncture."" IBT reached out to India's Ministry of External Affairs and the Qatar embassy in India but did not immediately receive a response. The Indian government has been granted consular access to the Indian nationals and making efforts to see the release of the eight ex-Navy officers. India's Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar previously called it a ""very sensitive case"" and said last December that the officers were a priority for India as well. He noted at the time that New Delhi was constantly in touch with the Qatari government. ""I was deeply distressed to learn about the death sentence,"" Fabian said. ""Having dealt with Qatar since 1988 as Joint Secretary (Gulf) and later as Ambassador there, I am convinced that it is most unlikely that the eight will be executed."" ""Qatar has a judiciary where the Court of Appeal has changed the harsher sentences given by lower courts. Even more important, the Amir grants pardon during Ramadan,"" he added. ""Of course, Ministry of External Affairs has its work cut out. We can be sure that MEA is at it. For good and sufficient reasons MEA must be exercising discretion. Let us hope and pray for an early pardon as the Ramadan 2024 April approaches."""

With… [+3593 chars]",Oman,"On a Yemeni beach, a sea turtle clambers ashore to lay eggs, which will likely be born female due to rising temperatures, creating a gender imbalance that brings the threat of local extinction. With sands made hotter by climate change, eggs are rarely yielding male turtles, which require cooler temperatures during the incubation period. Studies in several coastal regions of southern Yemen ""have shown that there are 90 percent more female sea turtles than males"", said Jamal Baouzir, director of the biodiversity department at the University of Aden. The severe gender imbalance will continue until it brings about the complete extinction of sea turtles in Yemen ""in the years to come"", Baouzir said. Environmental activist Hafiz Kelshat said the proportion of males had ""decreased considerably"" in recent years. ""Most baby turtles are female due to the change in temperature,"" he told AFP on a nesting beach in Mahra province, near the border with Oman. This is especially the case in summer, when temperatures often top 31 degrees Celsius (88 degrees Fahrenheit) -- the point at which sea turtle eggs begin yielding females. The gender imbalance is getting worse each year as longer periods of extreme heat hit the Arabian Peninsula, one of the world's hottest regions. The problem is not unique to Yemen, wracked for nearly a decade by a devastating civil war which has created one of the world's worst humanitarian tragedies. From the US state of Florida to Australia's Great Barrier Reef, male sea turtle numbers are dwindling due to climate change. In 2018, US researchers found that rising temperatures meant most of the 200,000 green turtles in the northern Great Barrier Reef are female, compounding the threat of extinction. Yemen, wedged between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, boasts a rich variety of natural habitats and species, many of them found nowhere else in the world. But its genetic diversity, and the potential for future tourism development it represents, are increasingly threatened by global warming. Yemen ranks as one of the region's most climate-vulnerable countries, according to the Global Adaptation Initiative of the University of Notre Dame in the US state of Indiana. Extreme heat and increasing rainfall variability leading to both drought and flash floods are among the challenges forecast for the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country. Baouzir said that to tackle the deepening gender imbalance, authorities should create ""a specialised technical team to monitor the turtles in their nesting places and place the eggs in appropriate incubators"" to produce male offspring. The provision of sun shields on beaches could also help reduce sand temperatures and boost the number of male hatchlings. But environmental conservation has inevitably taken a back seat to the grinding civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and left the country's infrastructure in tatters. ""The current circumstances, of course, make it difficult to carry out"" protection operations, Baouzir said. An environment ministry official in the internationally-recognised government, which controls Mahra province along with much of the south, acknowledged that conservation efforts had suffered during the war with Iran-backed Huthi rebels. ""The authorities have worked on various plans including the creation of several reserves,"" Naif Ali bin Masaad said. But they are ""busy with the war against the Huthis and terrorist groups... so they do not assume their responsibilities"" towards environmental protection, the official said."

The top Iranian diplomat proposed that foreign ministers of Islamic countries hold an emergency meeting soon over the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories. He said that the Zionist regime has in recent months stepped up its crackdown against Palestinians, from killing women and children to imprisoning people, and constantly desecrated Al-Aqsa Mosque, prompting the ongoing response from resistance groups. Iran and Oman have always supported the Palestinian people, Amirabdollahian told his counterpart, adding that the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank need the support of the Islamic countries more than ever. The top Omani diplomat said on his part that his country expresses sympathy over the martyrdom of hundreds of Palestinians by the Zionist regime. He also said that the Palestine issue should be regarded as a top global priority, calling on the international community to recognize the Palestinians' right to decide their fate and liberate their occupied lands. The two ministers agreed to continue talks over the regional developments and pursue the holding of an emergency meeting of the Islamic countries. 4194  "

A representative of the Ministry of Heritage and Tourism, Sultanate of Oman said Omani officials began communicating with Indian wedding planners many years ago to promote the Sultanate as a potential location for  Indian couples  looking to experience the warmth and beauty of the country as a wedding destination.  ""Oman is closer and has better airline connectivity to India than other preferred destinations by Indian couples. It is also the perfect location for visitors coming from Europe and other parts of the world to attend Indian weddings,"" says Arjun Chadha, Country Manager India, Buzz Travel Tourism.  "" Salalah , with its natural topography, global hospitality brands and seamless infrastructure, is among the most sought-after destinations perfectly suited for unique weddings,"" Chadha told PTI in Muscat.  Among the coveted wedding locations are  Alila  Jabal Akhdar, nestled in one of the region's highest mountains, and Alila Hinu Bay, a beach property. They offer an awe-inspiring romantic backdrop in terms of nature.  Alila Hinu Bay, a 45-minute drive from Salalah airport, offers its guests a true 'Arabian Nights' experience in the old coastal town of Mirbat.  Hanadi Jawhari, marketing and communication manager of Alila Hinu Bay said, ""With its sophisticated design, the property carries a heavy influence of  Omani architecture  paired with its minimalist aesthetics that perfectly blend with the local climate and culture, including the spectacular Omani archway corridor creating a regal feel.""  ""Many couples choose Oman for their wedding as it is a unique destination that offers warm hospitality and luxury that matches the Indian taste,"" she said.  Puneet Singh, General Manager of Alila Jabal Akhdar Resort said, ""Jabal Akhdar caters to two main sets of clientele. During winter, which spans from September to April, we welcome European guests who typically spend a few days in Muscat, a day in the desert, and a few days in the mountains.  ""In winter, the weather here is fantastic, making outdoor activities like hiking, exploring trails, and engaging in our signature activity, via Ferrata, very popular. Some guests simply unwind, relax, and enjoy our spa, pool, and dining options,"" Singh said.  Among the many attractions in Oman is Muscat's oldest Muttrah fort, dating back to the 16th century.  For the adrenalin-guzzled tourist, there is the option of snorkelling in the colourful coral reefs of the Daymaniyat Islands or camping under the stars in the Sharqiya Sands.  The Ministry of Heritage and Tourism, Sultanate of Oman conducted a four-city roadshow in India this year, starting with Delhi and concluding in Mumbai after similar shows in Jaipur and Kolkata.  Chadha said the roadshow got an overwhelming response from the Indian travel trade. Oman's rich cultural heritage, stunning natural landscapes, and thrilling adventure activities make it an attractive destination for Indian travellers, he said.  With the growing interest in offbeat and experiential travel, Oman offers a perfect blend of tradition and modernity that captivates the hearts of our travellers, he said.  Wisps of frankincense smoke wafted through the bazaar as one plunged through the crowded  Mutrah  Souq of Muscat.  The Frankincense is an integral part of Oman's culture and heritage. This aromatic resin is mostly used in incense and perfume and obtained from the bark of Boswellia genus trees.  The Museum of the Land of Frankincense at Al Baleed in Salalah borders the ruins of Al Baleed Archaeological Park. Visitors can discover how trade with Frankincense and maritime strength ensured that the region flourished in the 12th century. Experience Your Economic Times Newspaper, The Digital Way!

An Israeli ground invasion to destroy Hamas, Arab analysts warn, could escalate into a wider regional conflict. Israel's peace partners, Jordan and Egypt, decry any mass transfers of Palestinians to their countries. As civilian deaths rise and the humanitarian situation deteriorates in Gaza, Israel has vowed to wipe out Hamas, designated by Israel, the United States and the European Union as a terrorist organization. Former Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher told an online Carnegie Mideast panel this week that eliminating the militants may prove difficult, as Hamas ""has become an ideology and not just a movement."" Muasher warned: ""If the Hamas military machine is destroyed, I am afraid many other Hamases will spring up."" ""Military solutions of this kind cannot solve this issue. Only a political process can. The problem with a political process, I just don't see who is going to lead one."" Muasher says that if Israel does not engage in a peace process leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state nor wants to govern the Palestinian majority inside the country, then he warns it may try to effect a mass transfer of Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt — which is unacceptable. ""The logical conclusion that Jordan and Egypt have is that if Israel does not want the first two options, then only the third option is to try get rid of as many Palestinians as possible. That is the real concern,"" Muasher said. Former Egyptian lawmaker Amr Hamzawy says while Egypt is working to allow aid in for the people in Gaza, it also is ""very worried about any scenario of displacement."" ""The Egyptian government position is fully backed by popular sentiment. We will not let our national sovereignty or the borders be abused to solve an Israeli problem of not accepting a two-state solution, of not accepting an end to the occupation, and getting rid of the Palestinian issue,"" Hamzawy said. On Thursday, Arab foreign ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates condemned what they called the targeting of civilians and violations of international law in Gaza. They said Israel's right to self-defense does not justify breaking the law and neglecting Palestinians' rights. They also expressed concern about a wider regional conflict developing. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told a press conference that Israel had ""no interest in expanding the war.""  "

Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari, the deputy chief of the Iranian Army for Coordination, said on Tuesday that nearly 200 drones cover strategic waters of the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman, all four corners of the country and its central part. According to Sayyari, the surveillance drones, operated by the four units of the Army, namely the Ground Force, Navy, Air Force and Air Defense Force, successfully carried out their intelligence-gathering and patrol missions on the first day of the Army's 1402 joint drone military exercise. ""Homegrown Chamorosh, Yasir, Sadeq, Pelican vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) naval drone, Ababil-3 tactical surveillance unmanned aerial vehicle, Yazdan, Ababil-4, Ababil-5, Kaman-12 (Bow-12) and Kaman-19 drones in addition to Mohajer-6 ISTAR aircraft were flown from different bases across Iran,"" he said. He added that the drones monitored the country's frontiers and identified designated targets in the general zone of the exercise as well as international waters. ""Due to the expansion of unmanned aerial capabilities, execution of various and numerous drone missions, and the need to coordinate such flights, the Army has as set up Zolfaqar command and control network for the drone operations,"" Sayyari said. ""This exercise exhibits only a small fraction of the achievements made by the Islamic Republic of Iran Army in connection with domestically-developed drones,"" he pointed out. Iran has made great progress in the drone industry in recent years. Last month, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Major General Mohammad Baqeri said the scope of foreign demand for sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicles developed and manufactured indigenously by the country's military specialists is much larger than its production capacity. Iran was once under arms embargoes on the purchase of foreign-made weapons, but now the Islamic Republic is faced with bans on the export of its domestically developed military products, Baqeri said on September 18. ""Today, the (number of) customers of our drones are several times more than our production capacity,"" Major General Baqeri said, adding that ""major world powers"" are vying to purchase Iranian weapons. Iran has turned into a ""big drone power"" that is outperforming major world powers, the commander said.  "

Some have told the … [+9004 chars]",Pakistan,"Hundreds of Afghans who risked their lives to work with the UK in Afghanistan and fled the Taliban are now stuck in neighbouring Pakistan as they wait to be relocated to the UK.  Some have told the BBC their days are spent living in fear, as Pakistan starts a crackdown on migrants without visas after cross-border tensions rose.  New court documents from Britain show that many face longer waits in part due to instructions by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - apparently to save money - banning their accommodation in hotels in the UK in all but extreme cases. The UK runs two schemes to resettle Afghans in Britain. The first is the Afghan Relocation and Assistance policy (ARAP) and the second is the Afghan Citizen Resettlement Scheme (ACRS).  The first is for Afghans who worked directly with British forces and their families, while the second is for those who worked in British-run civil schemes or are in vulnerable minority groups. Marzia, an assumed name, was an English teacher for the British Council. She is heavily pregnant and has been waiting for a UK visa for eight months. ""My physical and mental health are not good,"" she says. ""When the Taliban took over Afghanistan our lives were in danger. We had to live in hiding.""  Marzia is just one of many Afghans who worked for or with the UK before the Taliban retook power in 2021.  Others include translators for the British army or worked on British-led projects to encourage democracy and equality.  All were told they qualify for one of the UK's resettlement schemes. All are in Pakistan because the UK asked them to come to process their visas.  Some have been here for months, others for more than a year. They have no legal access to education or work.  Most we spoke to did not want to be quoted. Those who did asked for anonymity; we have changed their names. Many told us they were afraid of repercussions on their case, or that they or their family in Afghanistan could be targeted by the Taliban.  The Taliban government has said there is an amnesty for Afghans who worked with international forces. Now there is a new fear: Pakistan has announced a crackdown on illegal migrants and plans to deport any without the right paperwork from the start of November. Marzia says her passport was taken by the UK authorities on her arrival and that her Pakistan visa has now expired.  In late September she says she was told by her caseworker at the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) - her point of contact in Pakistan - that she should not leave her guest house.  That has meant she has already missed a doctor's appointment and doesn't know what to do about the birth.  ""It's impossible for me to give birth to my baby inside my hotel room. There isn't any facility [or] anyone to help me,"" she says.  ""Me and my baby's health will be in danger. We worked for them, [now] it's time for them to help us.""  Five other people with expired Pakistan visas also said the IOM, or their guesthouse quoting the IOM said, that they should not leave the premises.  When asked, the IOM told the BBC that they had ""not given the advice mentioned"", saying: ""IOM only advises to leave information about their whereabouts at their accommodation reception when leaving the premises to ensure follow up and support when and if needed.""  Their plight comes as the British government and several ministers are sued by two Afghans, who say that their promised resettlement has been delayed in part by a November 2022 decision made by Mr Sunak. An email from the prime minister's office, submitted as evidence to the High Court in London yesterday, shows that Mr Sunak wanted to ""manage the flow"" of ARAP cases. His direction stated that those on the scheme would only be flown to the UK once suitable housing was found. Hotels were no longer an option. The email says that this ""should represent an overall net saving to the taxpayer"". Other emails show that the Ministry of Defence thought this applied to both UK schemes. Lawyers for the two refugees said that Mr Sunak's directive had effectively halted relocations - no visas had been issued between December 2022 and July of this year unless accommodation had been secured - and that this was done to save money. The government's lawyers said that accommodation in Pakistan was ""not ideal"" but ""adequate"", that those on the scheme had access to case workers and that there was ""no legal obligation"" for the government to provide education in this situation. While resettlement attempts had 'accelerated' this month - the BBC understands there are still flights bringing some Afghans to the UK - the government lawyers said there would still be about 2,300 in Pakistan on one scheme alone at the start of November. We spoke to people on both of the UK government schemes. There is no way for the UK to process visa applications in Afghanistan so those approved for the schemes are asked to make their own way to a third country - usually Pakistan - for final checks.  Even leaving the country is difficult; there is a long waiting list in Afghanistan for passports and obtaining a visa for Pakistan can take months. We spoke to several people who, despite the amnesty, said they lived in hiding from the Taliban government.  In Pakistan, the UK government pays for their rooms and food, and many told the BBC that they had been told to bring minimal money to avoid issues at the border. They say they were told or assumed they would only spend a few weeks in Pakistan but have found themselves stuck with no answer from the UK.  One charity that works to campaign for Afghan interpreters, the Sulha Alliance, told us that many had waited for more than a year - some were nearing two.   The group's co-founder Sara de Jong said the schemes were essential lifelines, but that ""their execution has been too slow and ineffective"".  ""Too many Afghan interpreters and others, who we promised to bring to safety more than two years ago, are still left in Afghanistan, or waiting in Pakistan or other third countries,"" Prof de Jong told the BBC. A UK government spokesperson said: ""We continue to honour our commitments to bring eligible Afghans to the UK, and will arrange and pay for their travel when suitable accommodation in the UK has been secured."" ""The UK has so far brought around 24,600 people to safety, including thousands of people eligible for our Afghan resettlement schemes.""  This figure includes British citizens and others with settled status already who were evacuated from Afghanistan during the operation in 2021 as a government website explains; 21,526 were on the ACRS and ARAP programmes.  The government's lawyers have said there is no set time within which a visa must be issued or people must be relocated to the UK. Jamal was a translator with the British army. He proudly shows me pictures of his time in uniform. He has spent more than five months in Islamabad and is currently staying with his children and wife in one room. He is unable to work legally, the only lessons his children have are English lessons online.  ""I left my parents in Afghanistan who need my support. I don't have a job here. My children missed a year of education because of Covid. After that the Taliban came [and] we missed the education of our children in Afghanistan. Now we also missed the children's education in Pakistan.""   He is joined by Qasim, who worked with UK authorities. He has spent six months living with his family of 10 in one room. He says he wishes he had not come.  ""In Afghanistan, girls can't get an education, but here none of my children can either,"" he told us. He feels that by joining the scheme, he would be at more risk were he to return.  ""Before we left Afghanistan, if our lives were at 50% danger, now they are in 100% danger."" Their fear of the police in Pakistan has intensified. While they say that they were always aware of the risk of being stopped while on the street, a little over a week ago others on the ARAP programme told them that police had entered their hotel in the early hours, taking several to a police station, only to release them a few hours later.  ""After the police started raiding hotels, Afghans have been under a lot of stress - it has caused them psychological problems,"" says Qasim. ""This is a severe action that no one can tolerate."" Jamal agrees, saying that there are ""no guarantees"" he won't be among the next to be arrested. The BBC has been shown a message from the British authorities saying that they ""are continuing to work with the Pakistani authorities to resolve issues around expired visas… and will take action to quickly resolve incidents should they arise"". But like others the BBC spoke to, Qasim and Jamal remain nervous. As with Marzia, they do not have their passports and their Pakistan visas have expired.  We asked the government about the legal status of those on the ARAP and ACRS programmes in light of the recent crackdown by Pakistan authorities on illegal migrants, but were not given a response.  Pakistan has said its efforts to crack down on illegal migrants are not specific to Afghans. However, the minister who announced the policy said that 1.7 million Afghans live in Pakistan illegally.  Analysts say the move is the result of increasing tension between the two countries - Pakistan has accused the Taliban of harbouring militant groups that attack Pakistanis.  Afghanistan denies this and says that Pakistan police are harassing Afghans even if they have proper documentation. The fallout will affect the many Afghans who have fled across the border to Pakistan over decades.  Amid the politics, those on these UK government schemes wait daily for an email or call that they will be leaving.  ""I supported them; I stayed with them side by side; shoulder by shoulder, and I supported them on the frontline, but I don't know what the British government is doing with us,"" says Jamal. ""They left us behind, many years ago."" ""My request to the British government is to please, do something quick, and take us to the UK because [it is not] good for us here."""

After an emergency meeting to discuss the repercussions of the attack, Borrell also said an ""overwhelming majority"" of EU foreign ministers supported continuing aid payments for the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank. Borrell made his statement the day after European Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi, a Hungarian diplomat,said all EU development aid for Palestinians was suspended- only for the Commission to disown his announcement after a backlash from EU governments. Borrell had invited the Israeli and Palestinian foreign ministers to take part by video conference in the meeting in Muscat, Oman. But Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen did not want to participate in a meeting that would also be addressed by Palestinian Authority minister Riyad al-Maliki so neither ended up taking part, officials said. Borrell repeated the EU's condemnation of attacks by Hamas that killed more than 1,000 Israelis, most of them civilians. But he said Israel's response - which has so far killed at least 770 Gazans, according to local officials - had to be in line with international humanitarian law and a decision to impose a total blockade on Gaza contravened this standard. ""Israel has the right to defend (itself) but it has to be done accordingly with international law, humanitarian law, and some decisions are contrary to international law,"" he told reporters after the meeting."

The ring's alleged leader, Fawad Mukhtar, is accused of extracting the kidneys of more than 300 people and transplanting them into rich clients.  He had previously been arrested five times for malpractice, but managed to secure bail each time.  At least three people died from having their organs harvested in this way, authorities said. The gang was believed to be operating across eastern Punjab province, as well as in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The transplants were carried out in private homes - often without the patient knowing, the chief minister of Punjab province Mohsin Naqvi said. A car mechanic is said to have worked as Mr Mukhtar's surgical assistant and helped lure vulnerable patients from hospitals. The kidneys were then sold for up to 10 million rupees (£99,000; $120,000) each, Mr Naqvi added.  ""The facts and figures that have come to us make the heart tremble,"" Mr Naqvi said during a press conference on Sunday. ""There are a lot more transplants and illegal surgeries than this. These are the ones that we have confirmed."" The commercial trade of human organs was made illegal in Pakistan in 2010. The punishment for those caught includes a decade-long jail term and huge fines in the hope that this will stop sales to overseas clients by exploitative doctors, middlemen, recipients and donors.  However, there has been a rise in organ trafficking in the country as people struggle with low wages and a poor enforcement of the law.  In January, Punjab police uncovered another organ trafficking ring after a missing 14-year-old boy was found in an underground lab after having his kidney removed. "

The match on Saturday has been described as the ""blockbuster event"" of the tournament - millions will tune in to watch the game and the 132,000-capacity stadium is expected to be full. Both sides have made confident starts in the tournament, winning their first two matches.  But India v Pakistan is one fixture where past performances don't guarantee a win. It's the ultimate test of skill, preparedness, strategy and above everything else, nerves. With millions of cheering fans who see the match as a war, it comes down to the players' ability to keep the noise out and treat it like any other game. Both teams have players who can do this to put up a performance that matches the monumental occasion. India will start as firm favourites because of their uncanny record of winning all seven World Cup matches against Pakistan.  But the visitors are unpredictable. They entered the Asia Cup in September as the world's top one-day team but crashed out in the semi-finals. But when it's their day, Pakistan can dismantle any side. Their batting prowess revolves around their charismatic but often understated captain Babar Azam. His sublime stroke play is a treat to watch but what makes him special is his ability to switch gears effortlessly. He paces his innings quietly, almost like hiding in plain sight. Before his opponents realise what's happening, his score has reached the 50s or 60s and then he starts hitting fours and sixes at will. He also stays calm on the field and gives little away - no matter how the match is going. India should also take note of his average in one-day internationals, which is at 70 since the last World Cup in 2019.  If he gets going, India will be in trouble. But he is not the only hurdle for them.  Wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan is in scintillating form - he scored an unbeaten 131 to help his side chase down Sri Lanka's imposing target of 344 on Tuesday.  Abdullah Shafique scored a century in the match and cemented his place in international cricket. Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq also have the ability to make things difficult for India. But what remains to be seen is whether they can rebuild the innings in case both Babar and Rizwan fall cheaply. If India manage to run through the top easily, they will be aiming to exploit the perceived weakness in the Pakistani middle-order.  But if the visitors lack in batting, their bowling could make up for it.  Pakistan's bowlers were sub-par against Sri Lanka, and the team's sloppy fielding didn't help them either. But the match against India is a theatre where every player wants to give his best performance. And that is the catalyst that Pakistan's bowlers might need to bounce back.  It's often said that Pakistan is a ""factory"" for fast bowlers as they consistently produce pacers who have either brute speed or swinging abilities that are almost like an artform. Shaheen Shah Afridi has both. His faultless ability to bowl consistently in the right areas and set up batters for a rash shot is now well known. India will look to either play him out quietly or launch an attack to subdue him at the start.  Pakistan will miss Naseem Shah as he is out because of an injury but Afridi will find fierce partners in Haris Rauf and Hasan Ali. Their spin department relies hugely on Shadab Khan and Mohammad Nawaz but there are questions over whether they can trouble Indian batters as much as their pace counterparts. India's star-studded batting line-up has the quality to mute Pakistani attack, especially spinners.  Captain Rohit Sharma, who showed his class and destructive ability with a 63-ball century against Afghanistan on Wednesday, will most likely start the innings with attacking left-hander Ishan Kishan. But he will miss his regular opening partner Shubman Gill if illness forces the latter to skip the match. Gill has been in top form and his absence will be felt but India has enough bench strength to fill in for him. Seeing Rohit amass runs has cheered Indian fans. He showed signs of being in good form with his seamless cover drives, thunderous sixes and fearless pull shots.  The Indian captain alone can take the game away from Pakistan if he gets going. He is an opener who likes to play deep and finish games. The right-hander scored five centuries - the most by any batter in a World Cup - in 2019. But if Pakistan can get past Rohit, they will face one of the game's all-time-greats - Virat Kohli.  He is a formidable opponent for Pakistan. Just last month, he scored a fluent century against them in the Asia Cup to help his side record an emphatic win. Few can forget his masterclass of an innings where he scored 82 to help India chase down 160 in the T20 World Cup in 2022 against Pakistan. Many fans call him the ""messiah"" who emerges every time India need him to perform. His ability to fight till the end often motivates other players around him - KL Rahul is an example. Rahul was the other centurion against Pakistan at the Asia Cup in September. When India were in deep trouble after losing three wickets for two runs in their opening World Cup match against Australia last week, the team again looked at the ""messiah"" to deliver - and he did. Once again it was Rahul at the other end as the duo batted almost until the finish to take their team to the target of 200 on a difficult wicket. The batting that follows Rohit, Rahul and Kohli also offers no reprieve. Shreyas Iyer and Suryakumar Yadav are stylish batters who can drop the anchor when needed and also go into attack mode if required. Then there are the dangerous all-rounders Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja who can provide late flourishes and finish games for India. The matches between the neighbours are often seen as a contest between India's famed batters and Pakistan's fierce bowling attack. But that's not the case any more. Today India has an enviable bowling line-up who have the ability to overrun Pakistani batting.  Jasprit Bumrah is almost unplayable when he finds his rhythm and he has been in good form since returning from a long injury hiatus. His pace partners Mohammed Shami and Mohammed Siraj are different in nature but can take crucial wickets when needed. While Shami believes in controlled aggression, Siraj is all about heart and pace. But India may not go with all three pacers if the wicket at the Narendra Modi stadium offers spin. In the spin department, Kuldeep Yadav has been a revelation. His comeback to the team has been sensational. In the Asia Cup match, he made Pakistani batters sweat for each run and finished the game with five wickets, helping India record an resounding win by 228 runs. Then there is Jadeja and veteran spinner R Ashwin who can put the brakes on Pakistan's innings with their accurate bowling. But the trick lies in the right combination - whether Rohit goes with three pacers and two spinners, or the other way around, will be a tough decision. The teams are likely to wait until the last moment to fine-tune their strategy. Meanwhile, there's no doubt that fans will get to see a good game of cricket. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Pakistan says 1.7 million such people must leave by 1 November or face arrest and deportation. Most are Afghans. Many refugees are terrified, having fled Afghanistan after the Taliban retook control in 2021. Others have been in Pakistan for decades. The deadline to leave technically expired at midnight on Tuesday.  However Pakistani media report that those who are in transit to leave the country will be allowed to continue their journeys throughout the day.  ""Where will we go if we are forced to leave Pakistan?"" asked one young woman.  Sadia, who has been studying in Peshawar in north-west Pakistan, said she escaped Afghanistan two years ago for a chance at getting an education, after the Taliban government barred girls and women from school under its harsh version of Islamic law. ""I am studying here in Pakistan and I wish to continue my education here. If we are forced to leave, I will not be able to continue my study in Afghanistan. My parents, my sister and brother are scared about the future,"" she told BBC Urdu. Tensions between the countries soared after a spike in cross-border attacks, which Islamabad blames on Afghanistan-based militants. Afghanistan's Taliban government, who deny providing sanctuary for militants targeting Pakistan, have called the move to deport undocumented Afghans ""unacceptable"". Throngs of refugees rushed to the border with Afghanistan on Tuesday -  the last day for them to leave or be deported - on trucks overflowing with clothes and furniture. Close to 200,000 Afghans have returned home as of Monday, Pakistan said. Reports said 20,000 journeyed to the border on Tuesday as time to leave ran out. Eight in 10 who left said they feared being arrested if they stayed, according to a UN report. Many of these refugees, who fled Afghanistan after the Taliban retook control of the government, fear that their dreams and livelihoods will be crushed - yet again. But Pakistan, which has been wrestling with an economic crisis in recent years, is short of patience. In July, the Pakistani rupee saw its sharpest drop against the dollar since October 1998. The UN's human rights office urged Pakistani authorities to stop deportations to avoid a ""human rights catastrophe"".  ""We believe many of those facing deportation will be at grave risk of human rights violations if returned to Afghanistan, including arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, cruel and other inhuman treatment,"" said Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman of the UN's human rights office. The Taliban government have all but broken their earlier promises to give women the right to work and study - the suppression of women's rights under their rule is the harshest in the world, Girls in Afghanistan are only allowed to attend primary school. They are not allowed in parks, gyms and pools. Beauty salons have been shut and women are required to be dressed in head-to-toe clothing. Earlier this year, the Taliban government also burned musical instruments, claiming music ""causes moral corruption"". Afghan singer Sohail said he fled the Afghan capital Kabul ""with only some clothes"" the night the Taliban seized control of the city in August 2021. ""I cannot live as a musician in Afghanistan,"" said Mr Sohail, whose family of musicians have been trying to make ends meet in Peshawar. ""We are facing a critical time, as we have no other options, the Taliban do not accept music in Afghanistan and we have no other options for livelihoods,"" he said. The Taliban government says it has set up a commission to provide basic services, including temporary accommodation and health services, to returning Afghans. ""We assure them that they will return to their country without any worries and adopt a dignified life,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Pakistan has taken in hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees over decades of war. About 1.3 million Afghans are registered as refugees while another 880,000 have received the legal status to remain, according to the UN. But another 1.7 million people are in the country ""illegally"", Pakistan's Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on 3 October, when he announced the expulsion order. The UN's figures differ - it estimates that there are more than two million undocumented Afghans living in Pakistan, at least 600,000 of whom arrived after the Taliban returned to power. Mr Bugti's order came after a spike in violence near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, often involving armed fighters including the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) - often known as the Pakistani Taliban - and the Islamic State militant group. The minister claimed ""14 out of 24"" suicide bombings in Pakistan this year were carried out by Afghan nationals. ""There are no two opinions that we are attacked from within Afghanistan and Afghan nationals are involved in attacks on us... We have evidence,"" he said according to state media reports. Unauthorised refugees will be deported if they do not leave, Mr Bugti said on Monday. He stressed the crackdown was not aimed at specific nationalities, but acknowledged that those affected are mainly Afghans. Earlier in September, Pakistan was hit by two suicide bombings which killed at least 57 people. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, with the TTP denying involvement - though Mr Bugti said one of the suicide bombers had been identified as an Afghan national. "

The case was jointly filed … [+2964 chars]",Pakistan,"NAIROBI, Kenya --An elite Kenyan police unit went on trial Tuesday on charges of wrongful death in the killing of an outspoken Pakistani journalist in Nairobi a year ago. The case was jointly filed by the journalist's widow and two Kenyan journalists' unions. Arshad Sharif was killed Oct. 23, 2022, when the car he was in with another Pakistani man sped up and drove through a roadblock checkpoint outside the Kenyan capital and police opened fire. Nairobi police at the time expressed regret over the shooting, saying it was a case of “mistaken identity” during a search for a similar car involved in a child abduction case. The 50-year-old journalist had fled Pakistan earlier that year to avoid arrest at home on charges of maligning Pakistan’s national institutions — a phrase used for critics of the powerful military, which has ruled Pakistan for half of its 75-year history. He stayed briefly in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom before arriving in Kenya. A team of Pakistani investigators later said Sharif's killing was a “planned assassination.” His widow, Javeria Siddique, filed the case against the Kenyan police unit, known as the General Service Unit or GSU, that was involved in the shooting. Kenyan police claimed Sharif did not stop at a roadblock on the outskirts of Nairobi but his family and Pakistani investigators disagreed, saying Shariff’s killing was planned in Pakistan. “I am suing the GSU because they committed the crime openly,"" Siddique said earlier in a phone interview with The Associated Press. ""For me, it was a targeted assassination because he was living in hiding in Kenya after receiving threats in Pakistan.” The case is being heard at the Kajiado High Court on the outskirts of Nairobi and along with Siddique, the Kenya Union of Journalists and the Kenya Correspondents have been listed as joint petitioners. The plaintiffs' submission to court accuses Kenyan authorities of “failing to prosecute officers involved in the wrongful death of Arshad” and demands “a public apology to the family of Sharif.” “It has taken us some time to go to court because we thought investigations will be carried out, and the officer who pulled the trigger prosecuted,"" a statement from the union said. “Nothing so far has happened, so we are justified to go to court.” Ochiel Dudley, the lawyer representing Shariff’s widow, said his legal team is ""assisting the family to pursue justice in Kenya.” In Islamabad, police have charged two Kenyan-based Pakistani businessmen who had hosted Sharif in the East African country with involvement in his killing. The case has drawn international criticism from rights groups. “Arshad Sharif was politically persecuted in Pakistan and sought safety in Kenya, only to meet death,” said Muthoki Mumo, the Committee to Protect Journalists' sub-Saharan Africa representative. “A year later, Kenyan authorities have dismally failed in their responsibility to credibly and swiftly investigate the killing,"" she added. “His family and colleagues deserve justice, and a more credible accounting of the circumstances surrounding his death than the dubious story provided by the police.”"

The magnitude 6.3 earthquake on Wednesday was about 28 kilometers (17 miles) outside Herat, the provincial capital, and 10 kilometers (6 miles) deep, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It triggered a landslide that blocked the main Herat-Torghondi highway, Information Ministry spokesman Abdul Wahid Rayan said. Janan Sayiq, a spokesman for the Afghan Taliban government’s national disaster authority said Wednesday's earthquake killed at least one person and injured around 120 others. The aid group Doctors Without Borders said Herat Regional Hospital received 117 who got injured in Wednesday’s temblor. The group, also known by its French acronym MSF, said it sent additional medical supplies to the hospital and was setting up four more medical tents at the facility. “Our teams are assisting in triaging emergency cases and managing stabilized patients admitted in the medical tents,” MSF said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Wednesday’s quake also flattened all 700 homes in Chahak village, which was untouched by the tremors of previous days. Now there are mounds of soil where dwellings used to be. But no deaths have been reported so far in Chahak because people have taken shelter in tents this week, fearing for their lives as tremors continue to rock Herat. Villagers are distraught over the loss of their homes and livestock, often their only possessions, and worry about the coming harsh winter months. Some said they had never seen an earthquake before and wondered when the shaking of the ground would stop. Many said they have no peace of mind inside the tents for fear the ""ground will open and swallow us at any moment.” The epicenter of Saturday's quake — also of the same magnitude 6.3 — was about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of the provincial capital, and several aftershocks have been strong. Taliban officials said more than 2,000 had died across Heratafter the earlier quakes. They subsequently said the quakes killed and injured thousands but didn't give a breakdown of casualties. Besides rubble and funerals after Saturday’s devastation,there is little left of the villages in the region's dusty hills. Survivors are struggling to come to terms with the loss of multiple family members and in many places, living residents are outnumbered by volunteers who had come to search the debris and dig mass graves. In Naib Rafi, a village that previously had about 2,500 residents, people said almost no one was still alive besides men who were working outside when the quake struck. Survivors worked all day with excavators to dig long trenches for mass burials. On a barren field in the district of Zinda Jan, a bulldozer removed mounds of earth to clear space for a long row of graves. “It is very difficult to find a family member from a destroyed house and a few minutes to later bury him or her in a nearby grave, again under the ground,” said Mir Agha, from the city of Herat, who had joined hundreds of volunteers to help the locals. Nearly 2,000 houses in 20 villages were destroyed, the Taliban have said. The area hit by the quakes has just one government-run hospital. On Tuesday, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Zinda Jan was the worst-affected area, with more than 1,300 people killed and nearly 500 people still reported missing. He said U.N. satellite imagery also indicated extreme levels of destruction in the district of Injil. “Our humanitarian colleagues warn that children are particularly vulnerable and have suffered severe psychological distress from the earthquake,” he said. Earthquakes are common in Afghanistan, where there are a number of fault lines and frequent movement among three nearby tectonic plates. Afghans are still reeling from recent quakes, including themagnitude 6.5 earthquake in Marchthat struck much of western Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan, and an earthquake thathit eastern Afghanistan in June 2022, flattening stone and mud-brick homes and killing at least 1,000 people. Zabihullah Mujahid, the main spokesman for the Taliban government, listed the countries that have so far aided the people affected by the quake in Herat, in a statement posted on X. He said Iran sent 15 vehicles loaded with aid alongside support and technical teams, while Turkey sent medical teams food, non-food items and medicine. The United Arab Emirates and Turkmenistan also helped with food, medicine, and clothes. He added a technical team of 49 members from Kazakhstan is assisting those affected by the quake. In his post, Mujahid said Saudi Arabia provided financial assistance to the people of Herat while China donated $200,000 in cash aid through the Afghan Foreign Affairs ministry. Neighboring Pakistan is among the countries that have offered assistance but the delivery of its humanitarian aid has been on hold since Monday. On Wednesday morning, the pledged supplies had yet to leave Pakistan. Authorities were waiting for “clearance” from the Taliban, two government officials in Islamabad said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Ties between the two countries have come under pressure sincePakistan announced a deadlinefor undocumented migrants, including 1.7 million Afghans living illegally in the country, to leave before Oct. 31 to avoid arrests and forced deportation."

He was battling age-related illnesses and had undergone a few surgeries in recent years. Bedi, regarded as one of the world's finest ever spin bowlers, captained India in 22 of his 67 Tests and took 266 wickets.  He made his debut against West Indies in 1966 and played his last Test against England at The Oval in 1979. Bedi also played English county cricket for Northamptonshire and finished his career with 1,560 first-class wickets, the highest by any Indian bowler.  Bedi was an integral part of a famed quartet of India's world-beating spin bowlers in the 1960s and 70s, which included Erapalli Prasanna, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar and Srinivas Venkataraghavan. In 2021, Bedi was picked by readers for a place in BBC Sport's all-time India Test XI. Born in Amritsar in India's Punjab state, Bedi began playing cricket at school. When he turned 20, he became the 113th cricketer to represent India in Tests.  Over a 12-year career his best bowling performance came in 1969 when he picked up seven wickets for 98 runs against Australia in Kolkata (then known as Calcutta), a Test match that India lost. In his trademark pink or bright blue turban, Bedi was a spin bowling purist's dream. With a languid run-up and a fluid action, bowling came naturally to him. Cricket writer H Natarajan described the left arm spinner as ""stealthy, silent and deadly, a master of deception who conjured variations in flight, loop, spin and pace without any perceptible change in action"".  ""Bedi flighted the ball higher than any bowler in international cricket; if he could challenge quick-footed batsmen thus, it was only because his command was so complete that he would make the ball descend far quicker than it went up,"" wrote Ramachandra Guha, a historian and author of A Corner of a Foreign Field, a book on Indian cricket.  Former India wicketkeeper Syed Kirmani, who played 88 Tests for India, once said Bedi had so much variation that he could ""bowl six different deliveries in an over"".  West Indies legend Sir Garry Sobers, one of the greatest all-rounders ever to play cricket, said Bedi ""took the weight off the ball nicely"". Mike Brearley, one of England's greatest captains, called his bowling ""beautiful"".  And Australia great Sir Donald Bradman, widely regarded as the game's best batter of all time, felt that ""Bedi was a real study for the connoisseur and amongst the finest bowlers of his type"". Bedi was also a rare outspoken cricketer, often getting embroiled in controversies.  In 1976, he declared India's second innings at 97-5 against Clive Lloyd's West Indies at Kingston, Jamaica, in protest against intimidatory bowling by the hosts. Three India batters were out of the game after being hit by West Indian quick bowlers, and Bedi said it was not a declaration because there were no fit players to come out and bat. West Indies won the game by 10 wickets. In 1977, he accused England left-arm fast bowler John Lever of using Vaseline to swing the ball during a tour of India. The next year, he forfeited a match against Pakistan, alleging partisan umpiring.  In 1990, as the national coach, he threatened to dump the India team in the sea after they lost a match against Australia. In 2002, he launched a stunning attack on Sri Lanka's spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan, accusing him of throwing.  ""If Murali doesn't chuck, then show me how to bowl,"" Bedi said in an interview published in Wisden Cricket Asia. Back in 1978, he refused a lucrative contract from Kerry Packer to play World Series Cricket, a rebel tournament in Australia, later recounting that Packer's agent had approached him three times with substantial offers. Decades later, he upbraided player auctions in the Indian Premier League, saying that he ""just did not like players being treated like horses being sold to the highest bidder"".  At home, Bedi never pulled his punches while criticising cricket board officials.  He asked for his name to be taken off from a stand at the main cricket stadium in Delhi in protest against the statue of a dead politician belonging to the ruling BJP being installed. He once appeared on a TV programme without permission and sought higher match fees for his team. ""If speaking one's mind is a crime, then I am guilty several times over,"" he said once. Bedi was an intensely social person and a flamboyant personality. His daughter remembered a ""home full of free-flowing alcohol, food and an insurmountable amount of loud laughter"". He loved dogs and brought various breeds from kennel clubs home from his stints in the UK.  The ""sardar of spin"" - as he was popularly called in India - had an infectious sense of humour.   In England, he once picked up two dogs from a kennel, named them Charles and Diana and took them to India. At the London airport, an official asked him, ""Are you taking the mickey out of our royalty?"". A deadpan Bedi replied: ""No! I am taking the royalty with me."" The wisecrack summed up Bedi in many ways: an irreverent personality, and a rebel of sorts. And of course, one of the greatest cricketers of all time.  "

As violence unfolds on the ground, I've been looking into who is behind this. When I opened up my TikTok For You Page earlier this week, I was met with a video showing a young Israeli woman being taken hostage by Hamas fighters on 7 October. The footage was shocking.  When I scrolled through the comments, the reaction was not what I expected.  While some were distressed by the post, other users falsely suggested this footage was not what it seemed.  They said the woman in it is ""not a civilian"" but a soldier, or that the clips had been staged to frame Hamas. Some claimed there's no evidence the group have acted violently towards hostages.  The clip, which has been verified by the BBC, shows a young woman covered in blood being pushed into a car by armed men. It was filmed on the outskirts of Gaza City in Sheijia.  I scrolled through several more videos and posts about hostages on other social media sites and spotted similar comments. Israeli people are subject to compulsory national service - but evidence suggests many of those taken hostage by Hamas are civilians, like the people featured in these videos. The hostages include festival-goers and children. Disinformation is not limited to accounts seeking to undermine violence against hostages, either. Profiles supporting the actions of the Israeli government have also shared misleading and hateful content.  One account I came across this weekend shared a video falsely suggesting Palestinian people were faking their injuries in Gaza. The footage was actually from a 2017 report about a makeup artist working on Palestinian films and with charities.  All of these claims were not just shocking to me - they affect the wider understanding of what's happening.  Successful attempts to distort and confuse the online conversation make it a lot harder to get to the truth of what's unfolding on the ground if you're relying on social media for updates.  That can have serious implications for the international community when it comes to investigating allegations of war crimes, providing aid and figuring out what's happening where. Sometimes, the source of these misleading posts is easier to identify.  Take, for example, celebrities, like popstar Justin Bieber, who inadvertently shared a post on Instagram asking people to ""pray for Israel' - but used images showing the destruction of Gaza by Israeli forces.  Several accounts on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a track record of pushing conspiracy theories about crises have amplified misleading posts in what seems to be a bid to either downplay or exaggerate what's happening on the ground.  That includes sharing old videos from different wars and footage from video games, which the accounts claim is from the current situation in Israel and Gaza.   Some very active accounts on X sharing pro-Israel content and anti-Muslim posts appear to be based in India and express support for the country's Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  I want to try to get to the bottom of the profiles whose identities and locations are less obvious. Several of the accounts suggesting that hostages were soldiers rather than civilians seem to belong to real, younger people. They have otherwise shared funny memes or football clips to their profiles.  Some have posted pictures with slogans like ""Free Palestine"". When I message them they tell me they are based in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.  For some profiles, whether they're real people is less obvious.  A handful have posted about an eclectic mix of political topics; in support of Russian President Putin and the war in Ukraine, as well as about former US President Donald Trump. Several of these accounts are newly set up or have recently become active.  In the past, both the Israeli government and Hamas militants have faced accusations of trying to distort online narratives with ""bot"" networks - inauthentic accounts used to repeatedly push divisive or misleading ideas.  According to Cyabra, a company based in Israel that analyses social media, one in five accounts taking part in conversations about the attacks committed by Hamas since 7 October are fake. ""Fake"" in this context can mean they are automatically operated - but others could also be run by real people posing under false identities. The company says they've found approximately 40,000 fake accounts, including on X and TikTok.  It says some of these profiles have been spreading misleading claims in support of Hamas and suggesting - for example - that militants were compassionate to hostages in situations where evidence suggests otherwise. That does not rule out the existence of inauthentic pro-Israel accounts, too.  There are clues we can use to identify an account as inauthentic. For example, if a profile is newly set up and is suddenly sharing a large amount of divisive, misleading and at times conflicting content.  Ultimately, though, determining whether a profile is actually fake and who exactly is behind it is a very difficult task. It requires information from the social media companies that journalists don't often have access to.  Social media sites have been widely criticised over the spread of disinformation this week. The EU is investigating X over the possible spread of terrorist and violent content, and hate speech. Former Twitter (X) employees have previously told me how the company is no longer able to protect against state-co-ordinated disinformation following layoffs under new owner Elon Musk. Ray Serrato, who tackled state-sanctioned campaigns at the social media company, told me how his former team was ""decimated"" after the takeover.  According to him, that means a number of key experts who ""covered special regions"" - including in the Middle East - and whose job it was to deal with specific co-ordinated disinformation operations, are no longer at the company.  X has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. The social media site this week said it had removed hundreds of Hamas-affiliated accounts from the platform.  In TikTok's Community Guidelines, the company says it has ""increased dedicated resources to help prevent violent, hateful, or misleading content on TikTok"" in relation to the current situation. The way that disinformation spreads on X, TikTok and other platforms can shape the general public's view of the situation in both Gaza and Israel.  That in turn could also put pressure on the politicians making big decisions about what's unfolding. "

The State Duma lawmakers voted unanimously to revoke the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in the third and final reading on Wednesday. The bill will now go to the upper house, the Federation Council, which will consider it next week. Federation Council lawmakers have already said they will support the bill. The legislation was introduced to parliament following a statement from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who warned earlier this month that Moscow could revoke its 2000 decision to ratify the treaty to “mirror” the stand taken by the United States, which has signed but not ratified the nuclear test ban. The treaty, adopted in 1996, bans all nuclear explosions anywhere in the world, although it has never fully entered into force. In addition to the U.S., it is yet to be ratified by China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel, Iran and Egypt. There are widespread concerns that Russia could resume nuclear tests to try to discourage the West from offering military support to Ukraine. Many Russian hawks have spoken in favor of a resumption. Putin has said that while some experts have talked about the need to conduct nuclear tests, he hasn’t yet formed an opinion on the issue. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said last week that Moscow will continue to respect the ban and will only resume nuclear tests if Washington does so first. Even after de-ratifying the treaty, Russia will remain a signatory, which “means that they still agree to abide by the terms of the treaty,"" so “it's not clear that we’re looking at the immediate restart of nuclear testing,” said Patricia Lewis, research director for international security at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. But the Russians are indeed challenging “the whole legislation that they helped set up on in terms of arms control, in terms of nonproliferation, in terms of stability, strategic stability, regional stability,” Lewis said. “From the bigger picture, what we’re seeing is an unraveling of the constraints and the checks and balances that we have in the system for controlling these horrific, inhumane weapons,” the analyst said."

If so, we’ve found the three rom-coms that are going to brighten your days on Hulu in October. BeyondShaun of the Dead, there aren’t a lot of successful unions between horror and romance. But one of this month’s picks is a blend of science fiction and romance. The other two picks include a classic Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant romance flick and a more recent romantic story that completely flew under the radar last year. These are the three rom-coms onHuluthat you need to watch in October. Robotstakes place almost a decade in the future, where androids are almost human-like, and there are no Blade Runners hunting them down when they go rogue. Regardless, it is illegal to have near-perfect humanandroiddoubles, which doesn’t stop Elaine (Shailene Woodley) and Charles (Jack Whitehall) from sending their identical duplicates out to do the hard work of living, dating, and scamming. This all goes wrong when the robot doubles, E2 and C2, decide that they’re really in love. The androids start off their affair with a crime spree while stealing the identities of their masters. That forces Elaine and Charles to team up to find their renegade robots in order to reclaim their identities. And they clearly don’t like each other as much as their doubles do. WatchRobotsonHulu. Notting Hillcame out in theaters almost a quarter century ago, and yet its premise has never been more relevant than it is now.Julia Roberts, in one of her best rom-coms ever, stars as Anna Scott, an actress who is basically as famous as the woman who portrays her. Local bookstore owner Will Thacker (Hugh Grant) wasn’t aware of this the first time that he met Anna. But they both felt sparks, and they keep coming back to each other for love and perhaps something more. Unfortunately, the press’ interest in Anna’s love life is overwhelming for both Will and Anna. That alone may keep them from ever discovering if they can make a life together. WatchNotting HillonHulu.

Zoe decides to follow Kaz back to Pakistan and make a film about the experience. But what Kaz soon discovers is that he and Maymouna have very little in common.

Islamabad, Pakistan– Pakistan’s government hasannouncedthat all undocumented migrants and refugees must leave Pakistan by the beginning of next month, either voluntarily or by force. Hundreds of thousands of them are Afghans. Citing a rising number of violent attacks, caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Tuesday that “14 out of 24” suicide bombings this year were carried out by Afghan nationals. “We have given them a deadline of November 1,” Bugti said, adding that nearly 4.4 million Afghan refugees live in the country – more than 1.7 million illegally. Here’s what you need to know about the government’s decision: Pakistan has seen a dramaticsurge in violencethis year with the majority of attacks occurring in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the southwestern province of Balochistan, both of which border Afghanistan. The government has repeatedly alleged that the Afghan Taliban is giving safe harbour to fighters belonging to the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which is ideologically aligned with the Afghan Taliban. Since the TTP’s decision to renege on a peace accord with the Pakistani government in November, the group has launched more than 300 attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province alone this year. The frequency and intensity of the attacks have been increasing. Thetwolatestattacksin Balochistan’s Mastung city and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu city last month killed more than 60 people and wounded dozens. Kabul, for its part, has denied the allegations, saying security concerns in Pakistan have nothing to do with Afghans. The interim Afghan government led by the Taliban gave a stinging rebuke of Pakistan’s announcement, calling it “unacceptable”. Government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid on Wednesday responded to Bugti’s remarks, urging the Pakistani government to “reconsider the decision“. Afghan refugees are not involved in Pakistan’s security problems, he said on X, formerly known as Twitter, adding that Pakistan “should tolerate them”. Pakistan sent a high-level delegation to Kabul for negotiations, the second such visit this year, and urged the Afghan Taliban to improve border controls. The two countries share a 2,640km-long (1,640-mile-long) border. It passes through rugged mountains, densely forested valleys and narrow rock passages. Its topography makes it porous and difficult to control.      Pakistan has conducted similar operations in the past, albeit with limited success. During a 2016 campaign, more than 600,000 Afghan immigrants, both registered and undocumented, returned to their country, according to data compiled by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). A Human Rights Watch report from 2017 called it the “world’s largest unlawful mass forced return of refugees in recent times”. That year saw the exodus of 150,000 Afghans while in 2018, after at least six extensions to a deadline to leave the country, almost 50,000 Afghan citizens, both registered and undocumented, were expelled, according to the UNHCR. At that time, Islamabad made similar allegations that TTP fighters were using Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan, and it carried out campaigns to expel immigrants, citing security concerns. According to estimates, more than 95 percent of refugees in Pakistan, both documented and undocumented, are Afghan nationals. The first influx of refugees began after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, which resulted in more than three million Afghans fleeing to Pakistan. Over the years, many of them returned home. This wave was followed by a second in 2001 when the United States invaded Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks. The UNHCR says 1.3 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan, 50 percent of whom are in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and 24 percent in Balochistan. A report released in July by Refugees International, an independent humanitarian group that advocates for displaced people, said that since thefall of Kabul to the Taliban in 2021, more than 600,000 Afghans have fled to Pakistan.      The government has not disclosed any plans about how it intends to deport undocumented people. The task to identify them has been given to the Ministry of Interior Affairs, and regional police and the Federal Investigation Agency are to carry out the deportations. Authorities have said a task force will be created to initiate the crackdown after the November 1 deadline, and those Afghans who do not have documentation will be handed over to Afghan officials unless they are wanted by authorities for suspected criminal activities.

In its latest step to implement the planned expulsion of all undocumented migrants, including 1.7 million Afghans, Pakistan is setting up deportation centres where people will be held during processing. Jan Achakzai, a spokesman for the southwestern Baluchistan government, said on Thursday that three deportation centres are being set up, including one in Quetta, the provincial capital. Azam Khan, the caretaker chief minister for the northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said three more centres are being set up there. “It is a challenging task,” interim Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti told reporters at a news conference. Authorities will begin tracking and arresting foreigners staying in the country without registration or documents from November 1, and sending them to the temporary centres. Migrants leaving voluntarily are offered incentives and help. More than 60,000 Afghans have returned home since the crackdown was announced, according to Khan. Anyone in the country irregularly should leave before the deadline to avoid arrest, Achakzai said. Pakistan’s caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti said there would be no deadline extension. Bugti said during a news conference on Thursday that no migrants living in Pakistan without authorisation would be mistreated after their arrests. “They will not be manhandled,” he said, adding that they would get food and medical care until their deportations. They are allowed to take a maximum of 50,000 Pakistani rupees ($180) out of the country, he said. The minister warned Pakistanis that action would be taken against them if they were found to be sheltering undocumented migrants after November 1. Bugti said the state has all the information about the areas where these migrants are hiding. Evicting those living in Pakistan without registration was a challenge for the state, but “nothing is impossible to achieve it”, he added. The country hosts millions of Afghans who fled their country during the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation. The numbers swelled after the Taliban armed group seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021. Pakistan denies targeting Afghans. The 1.4 million Afghans who are registered refugees will not be affected by the crackdown. The United States and the United Nations have appealed to Pakistan to reconsider this course of action, saying it will result in many injustices and human rights violations and families being separated. Former US diplomats and representatives of resettlement organisations urged Pakistan not to deport Afghans who are waiting for US visas under a programme that relocates at-risk refugees fleeing Taliban rule.

On October 3, Pakistan’s interim governmentannouncedit was giving “illegal immigrants” 28 days to leave the country. Those who do not do so would be forcefully deported starting on November 1. This unprecedented measure is directed specifically at the 1.73 million Afghans who have fled to Pakistan and who have not been able to attain formal refugee status. The announcement was made after the Pakistani government alleged that 14 out of 24 suicide bombings this year had been carried out by individuals holding Afghan citizenship. It has not put forward any evidence to support this claim yet. The threat of deportation has beencondemnedby multiple international organisations and governments. I, and many other Afghans, would attest to the warm hospitality Pakistan has shown Afghan people through the years. Afghans have had significantly better opportunities to study, live and work in Pakistan compared with other countries in the region. This long history of friendship should not be poisoned by short-sighted and reactionary decisions. The treatment of Afghan refugees has already deteriorated significantly in Pakistan in recent years as they have been persistently blamed for security failures within the country. Over the past few years, the Tehreek-e-Taliban-e-Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, has ramped up its attacks on security personnel and civilians. The Pakistani security apparatus and army have struggled to contain its terrorist activities, and government officials have repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of harbouring the group. It is important to put these developments in context. Pakistan played a key role in creating and bringing to power the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s. During the 20-year US occupation of Afghanistan, the Pakistani establishment gave refuge to the group. The TTP is a byproduct of this relationship. The leaders of the TTP all trained and developed bonds with the leaders of the Taliban during their time in the tribal areas of Pakistan. But the TTP was formed in Pakistan and has operated for most of its existence from within the country. Even if one were to accept the claim that today the Afghan Taliban allows the TTP’s leadership to operate from eastern Afghanistan, let us remember that the Afghan people did not choose the Taliban to rule them and they should not be punished for its decisions. Let us also recall that the elected Pakistani government was among the first to congratulate the Taliban on taking over Kabul and then-Prime Minister Imran Khan even called it “breaking the chains of slavery”. It is important to note that the Afghan Taliban has made concrete progress in fighting terrorist groups, which has been acknowledged by the United States, China, Russia and countries in Afghanistan’s immediate neighbourhood. It has systematically attacked cells of the Islamic State-Khorasan Province, which claimed a deadly suicide bombing in July in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Its government in Kabul has also made an effort to address Pakistan’s security concerns regarding the TTP. In 2022, the Taliban hosted negotiations between Pakistan and the TTP that resulted in a ceasefire lasting five months. When the Pakistani military carried out air raids in April last year on Afghan territory, violating Afghanistan’s sovereignty and killing civilians, the Taliban government had a rather mellow reaction, issuing a statement condemning the attacks as “cruelty”, a response that was quite unpopular among Afghans. Then in August, the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, issued a decree forbidding cross-border attacks. In late September, Taliban government forces detained about 200 TTP fighters on Afghan territory. Against the backdrop of all these events, it is unfortunate that the Pakistani government decided to ignore the potential for meaningful security cooperation and take a populist and inhumane decision to expel Afghans. Pakistan is a nation born duringthe biggest migration of peoplein modern history. Its people know what seeking safe haven means. They also know the trauma of collective punishment. Today as Pakistanis are standing up to denounceIsrael’s collective punishment of Palestinians, they should not close their eyes and stay silent about the decision to expel an Afghan population almost as large as that of Gaza. I call upon our friends in Pakistan to appeal to their government and demand that they respect the Afghan refugees’ basic rights to dignity and safety. African American poet Maya Angelou once said: “No one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark.” Pakistanis should not let those who need kindness the most become the victims of ill-conceived foreign policies. If carried out, this cruel act of deportation would negatively affect relations between both countries for years to come.

The bill to end ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, approved in the lower house last week, will now be sent to Putin for final approval. Putin has said  that revoking Russia’s 2000 ratification would “mirror” the stance of the U.S., which signed but did not ratify the nuclear test ban. State television showed Putin directing the exercise via video call with top military officials. Russia's Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu said the purpose of the drills is to practice “dealing a massive nuclear strike with strategic offensive forces in response to a nuclear strike by the enemy.” While similar drills are held every autumn, Shoigu's pointed comments came amid soaring tensions between Russia and the West over the fighting inUkraine. The test ban treaty, adopted in 1996, bans all nuclear explosions anywhere in the world, but the treaty was never fully implemented. In addition to the U.S., it is yet to be ratified by China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel, Iran and Egypt. There are widespread concerns that Russia could move to resume nuclear tests to try to discourage the West from continuing to offer military support to Ukraine. Many Russian hawks have spoken in favor of a resumption of the tests. Putin has noted that while some experts have argued that it's necessary to conduct nuclear tests, he hasn’t yet formed an opinion on the issue. Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said earlier this month that Moscow will continue to respect the ban and will only resume nuclear tests if Washington does it first. Ryabkov said Wednesday that the Russian Foreign Ministry had received U.S. proposals to resume a dialogue on strategic stability and arms control issues, but noted that Moscow doesn't consider it possible in the current political environment. “We aren't ready for it because the return to a dialogue on strategic stability ... as it was conducted in the past is impossible until the U.S. revises its deeply hostile policy course in relation to Russia,” Ryabkov told reporters in comments carried by Russian news agencies."

Pakistan has ordered all undocumented immigrants, mainly nearly 1.73 million Afghan nationals, to voluntarily leave the country or face deportations. “We have given them a November 1 deadline,” Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Tuesday amid claims by Islamabad that 14 of 24 suicide bombings in the country this year were carried out by Afghan nationals. Bugti said an estimated 1.73 million Afghan nationals in Pakistan have no legal documents to stay, adding that a total of 4.4 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan. “There are no two opinions that we are attacked from within Afghanistan and Afghan nationals are involved in attacks on us,” he said. “We have evidence.” Islamabad has received the largest influx of Afghan refugees since the Soviet invasion of their country in 1979. About 1.3 million Afghans are registered refugees in Pakistan and 880,000 more have legal status to remain, according to the latest United Nations figures. “If they do not go, … then all the law enforcement agencies in the provinces or federal government will be utilised to deport them,” Bugti said. It was not immediately clear how Pakistani authorities could ensure the undocumented immigrants leave or how they could find them to expel them. Pakistan’s announcement, called “harassment” by the Afghan embassy in Islamabad, marked a new low in its relations with Kabul, which have deteriorated sinceborder clashesbetween the South Asian neighbours last month.      In a statement on X, the embassy said more than 1,000 Afghans have been detained in the past two weeks – half of them despite having a legal right to be in Pakistan. “Despite the repeated promises of the Pakistan authorities, the arrest and harassment of Afghan refugees by the police in Pakistan continues,” it said. Fazal Rehman, a 57-year-old Afghan fruit seller in the northwestern city of Peshawar, said he arrived in Pakistan 30 years ago and his children have never been to Afghanistan. He said he had never felt the need to register with Pakistani authorities and now fears it is too late to do so. “We request the Pakistan government not to expel us in such a hasty way and allow us either to live here peacefully, or we should be given at least six months to one year time to go back,” he said.

A Pakistani court has granted bail to three-time former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in two corruption cases. Sharif was convicted in the two cases after his removal as prime minister in 2017. TheIslamabad High Court on Tuesday gave Sharif bail until Thursday and prosecutors did not object, trusting he would turn up for the trial, Sharif’s lawyer Azam Nazeer Tarar said. Sharifreturned to Pakistanlast week after four years of self-imposed exile in London in a bid to stand in next year’s elections against his biggest rival, former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Sharif had not set foot in Pakistan since2019 when he travelled to the United Kingdom’s capital for medical treatment while serving a14-year prison sentence for corruption. Earlier, his bail in a separate case was confirmed by a corruption court in Islamabad. “A date will be fixed by the court for when proceedings should start,” Naseer Ahmed Bhutta, another of Sharif’s lawyers, told the Agence France-Presse news agency outside the court. “He will attend all proceedings that he is required to.” Currently, Khan, Sharif’s successor, is imprisoned on corruption charges and serving a three-year sentence. Khan was removed from office in a no-confidence vote in April 2022, but he is still Pakistan’s leading opposition figure and enjoys a large following along with his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party. Like Khan, Sharif is not currently eligible to run for a seat in parliament. Khan on Monday was indicted in a case in which he is accused of revealing official secrets after his ouster. He faces a possible death sentence in this case and will likely be unable to run in the parliamentary elections. Sharif has returned to lead the campaign for his Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) party ahead of theelections, due in January. Ahsan Iqbal, a senior PML-N official, said Sharif should be allowed to contest the vote. “We hope that the injustice that was done to him … should be rectified,” Iqbal said. “It is the right of Mr Nawaz Sharif to lead his party, to lead his people andto lead Pakistanto turn around the country.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

In the wake of the violence, rather than trying to calm tensions in the Muslim-majority region,Russian President Vladimir Putinmade unevidenced claims that the West was responsible for the unrest. ""The events in Makhachkala last night were instigated through social networks, not least from Ukraine, by the hands of agents of Western special services,"" he said in a meeting of the Russian Security Council,according to the AFP news wire. He added that there had been ""attempts"" to destabilize Russian society, and accused the US of being behind the war between Israel and Hamas, which triggered the riots, reported the AFP. ""Who is organizing the deadly chaos and who benefits from it today, in my opinion, has already become obvious... It is the current ruling elites of the US and their satellites who are the main beneficiaries of world instability,"" Putin said. The Russian president has long accused the West of sowing chaos and instability, with Kremlin propagandists casting the war in Ukraine as part of a plot by the West to destroy Russia. Putin's latest remarks are part of a wider plan to convince the world that the West is the enemy — and some countries are buying it. One of Putin's core objectives is to break Western attempts to isolate Russia as punishment for the Ukraine invasion. As part of this, a Russian disinformation campaign has been seeking to link Western-supplied Ukrainian weapons to theHamas terrorist attackson October 7 against Israel, which sparked the war in the Middle East. Analysts say the campaign, along with Putin's latest comments, could deepen the rift between the US, Israel, and Europe, and nations in the Middle East and so-called ""Global South,"" which includes Brazil, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and China. ""The war in the Middle East will drive a growing wedge between the West and countries like Brazil or Indonesia, key swing states of the Global South,"" Clifford Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based risk assessment organization,told The New York Times. ""That will make international cooperation on Ukraine, like sanctions enforcement on Russia, even harder."" For its part, the US has sought to rally global opposition to Russia by pointing to the atrocities, infrastructure attacks, and human rights abuses committed by the Russian military in Ukraine. But in its adamant support for Israel's campaign in Gaza, which, has so far killed around 8,000 people, it has opened itself to accusations of hypocrisy, analysts say. ""All the discourse and the efforts of the West have been undermined. It's a godsend for Moscow, which hopes to break out of its isolation on the international stage by virtue of the opening of this new front in the Middle East,"" Tatiana Kastueva-Jean, director of the Russia/Eurasia Center of the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI), told Le Monde. ""Russia's invasion has brought to the surface accumulated global anger and resentment towards European countries and the US, whether for centuries of colonialism and neocolonial practices or for the double standards western countries have so often displayed towards the violations of rights and law in different parts of the world,"" Nathalie Tocci, director of the Italian Institute of International Affairs,wrote in The Guardian. Putin is exploiting this rift. In repeatedly portraying the US as the source of the unrest, he wants to bolster not just existing alliances, such as those with Syria, and Hamas' main backer Iran, but also gain favor with the Gulf states whose leaders are traditionally aligned with Washington and whose populations support Palestinian autonomy. The Russian president has good relations with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but apparently sees there is more to be gained in stirring opposition to Israel's campaign in Gaza and its alliance with the US. Russia in recent weeks hosted the leaders of Hamas, the organization behind the October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel, and criticized the Israeli response to the attacks, even likening the Israeli attacks on Gaza to the siege of Leningrad in World War II. In generating anger at the West over war in the Middle East, Putin is betting that he can turn the tables, and the West, not Russia, will be facing isolation."

Fireworks and celebratory gunfire raked Kabul’s skies as Afghans celebrated their stunning eight-wicket Cricket World Cup defeat of Pakistan, a rare burst of public jubilation since the Taliban takeover two years ago. Hundreds of fans swarmed the streets of the capital late on Monday, joining a morass of honking car traffic which wardens struggled to tame. Ecstatic passengers hung off car doors as pedestrians danced and played music despite an effective ban on song and dance dictated by the Taliban government. “Afghanistan has been through so much recently, such moments are always special and must be celebrated properly,” said Kabul resident Sharifullah, who goes by one name. “It feels like we have won the World Cup,” the 25-year-old told the AFP news agency. “Sport always brings unity among the people. Today we are celebrating the victory as a nation.” A superb batting and bowling display saw Afghanistan record their highest chase in ODI cricket, with a successful pursuit of a 283-run target set by Pakistan. It was their first-ever victory over Pakistan in eight ODIs and came just a week after their shock victory over defending champions England. Afghans have been glued to screens of all sizes in recent days – from mobile phones to restaurant TVs and a small number of big screens broadcasting in public parks. Afghanistan and Pakistan have had fractious relations since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, with Islamabad claiming Kabul is failing to rein in armed groups plotting strikes on its soil. Authorities recently pledged to evict 1.7 million undocumented Afghan refugees who have crossed into the country over the past several decades during successive conflicts. Opening batsman Ibrahim Zadran, who was awarded player of the match for his superb 87-run innings, dedicated the win to “people who are sent from Pakistan back home to Afghanistan”. Although records show cricket being played in Afghanistan more than a century ago, most of the country’s top players learned the game in refugee camps in Pakistan. “We had never witnessed such an amazing performance,” said 23-year-old Taliban government employee Noor Ahmad. “Tonight, Afghanistan’s people are enjoying it, and Pakistan’s people are crying. “We want to celebrate all night. We are going to live and enjoy the moment till morning,” he said. Afghanistan’s win was hailed by the Taliban government, which has enforced an austere imagining of Islam, squeezing women out of public life and effectively barring their participation in sports. “We congratulate the national cricket team, cricket board, and all Afghans on this victory,” said Maulawi Abdul Kabir, political deputy of the prime minister’s office. “This competition showed that Afghan youths are capable in any field and can win. We wish them more success.” Many members of the Afghan women’s cricket team fled the nation as the Taliban swept back to power. Earlier this month, players who settled in Australia told AFP they had been threatened for taking part in activities which brought “dishonour” to their faith, country or families. There is still debate over whether Afghanistan should lose its International Cricket Council membership for cutting women out of the game, a move which would effectively ban their men from playing international matches. But for 30-year-old Hamidullah, Monday night’s win offered an uncomplicated moment of joy. “We thank our national team from the bottom of our heart for this victory,” he said. “We waited forever to win against Pakistan, and finally, today was the day.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

The crackdown on undocumented migrants is mostly affecting some two million Afghans living in Pakistan without papers, though the government says it targets all undocumented or unregistered foreigners. The campaign has drawn widespread criticism from United Nations agencies, rights groups and the Taliban-led administration in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s interior minister said 64 Afghans were rounded up, detained and deported on Wednesday. “Today, we said goodbye to 64 Afghan nationals as they began their journey back home,” Interim Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “This action is a testament to Pakistan’s determination to repatriate any individuals residing in the country without proper documentation.” Thousands of refugees had crammed into trucks and buses on Tuesday and headed to the two key border crossings to return home to avoid arrest and forced deportation. According to the UN agencies, there are more than two million undocumented Afghans in Pakistan, at least 600,000 of whom fled after the Taliban takeover in 2021. Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Taliban-led administration have become strained over the past two years because of stepped-up attacks by the Pakistani Taliban, a separate militant group that is allied with the Afghan Taliban.

Pakistan have kept alive their slim hopes of qualifying for the semifinals of the ICC Cricket World Cup bydefeating Bangladesh by seven wickets, thanks to an opening partnership of 100 runs between Abdullah Shafique and Fakhar Zaman. Zaman marked his return to the side with a belligerent knock of 81 runs as Pakistan chased the target of 205 in 32.3 overs at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Tuesday. Earlier, Pakistan’s pace bowlers combined to take eight wickets as Bangladesh were dismissed for 204 runs in 45.1 overs. Electing to bat, Bangladesh could never really recover from a top order collapse as Pakistan’s three-pronged pace attack impressed with the new ball and were equally effective in the death overs with only Mahmudullah (56) managing a half-century for Bangladesh. The defeat, Bangladesh’s sixth, has ended Shakib al-Hasan’s team’s hopes of qualifying for the semifinals. Bangladesh have only won one match in the tournament. Pakistan have now won three matches from their seven and still have amathematical chanceof qualifying. Babar Azam’s men have moved to fifth place in the points table.

Indian-administered Kashmir –It’s always a highly charged affair wheneverIndia and Pakistanplay each other in cricket, but in the disputed, conflict-torn region of Kashmir, it’s on another level entirely. As in the past, Saturday’s ICCCricket World Cup clashbetween the two countries, held in the northern Indian city of Ahmedabad, brings risks – as well as some opportunities – to residents in cricket-crazed, Indian-administered Kashmir. Traditionally, most residents in Kashmir have supported Pakistan in every sport. But in cricket, emotions can especially boil over, sometimes leading to protests. The locals in the Muslim-majority region justify their outbursts by citing the frustrations and pressures of life under the long-standing conflict, calling it the reflection of Kashmir’s “political reality”. “When it comes to cricket, people mostly support the Pakistan team,” said Musharraf, an avid cricket fan in north Kashmir’s Baramulla town. “The match’s outcome could mean celebrations or otherwise in the region.” The main bone of contention in India and Pakistan’srocky relationshipis Kashmir; two of the three wars they’ve fought have been over the region. While both countries administer a part of the divided territory, they both claim the region in its entirety. In Kashmir, Indian governments have long used cricket as a “loyalty” test for locals, but the pressure has greatly intensified under the right-wing, Hindu-nationalist rule of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in power since 2014. “I remember from my childhood days, the celebrations of Pakistan winning the game used to be unique. The fans would burst firecrackers and women would sing in the streets in praise of the favourite cricketers, but all that has changed now,” said 35-year-old Muhammad, a cricketer who has played in five interstate cricket tournaments. “There are curbs on free expression and one can’t support the Pakistan team openly.” Since theabrogation of Article 370in 2019, when the authorities stripped the region of its limited autonomy, there has been acrackdown on dissent. During every India-Pakistan match, the security and intelligence agencies keep an eye on social media activities – and the surveillance has reached an unprecedented level. Kashmiris now fear that openly expressing their support for the Pakistan cricket team could land them in jail. The authorities have taken legal action against people posting tweets or WhatsApp statuses favouring the Pakistani team. In some cases, individuals have also been charged under thestringent antiterrorism lawthe Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). There have also been several instances when Kashmiri students studying outside the region were physically assaulted or arrested after India lost a cricket match to Pakistan. On Friday evening, the Jammu and Kashmir Students Association (JKSA), a local student union, advised students studying in India to refrain from posting about cricket on social media. Many residents of Kashmir say they will also be more cautious in expressing their feelings during this Cricket World Cup. “It is impossible to support the Pakistan cricket team even if done in the spirit of sportsmanship. Such support is easily construed as an anti-national act. If the government does not punish us, then random ring-wing users on social media will,” a 32-year-old resident of Srinagar, who did not want to be named, told Al Jazeera. He said that Kashmiris have been doxxed – whereby private information such as addresses or contact details are posted online – and also suspended or fired from jobs over support for Pakistan’s cricket team. “Such an intimidating climate automatically forces us to censor our expressions,” he said, before adding that it has not diminished the craze for cricket in Kashmir.      Inside Church Lane in Srinagar, a high-security location that houses the residence of the region’s top bureaucrats and officers, young girls and boys are busy playing cricket under the shade of chinar trees at Sher-I-Kashmir Cricket Stadium. The stadium was named after the first prime minister of Kashmir, Muhammad Sheikh Abdullah, known as “sher” (“lion”) to his supporters, whose National Conference party has ruled for most of the last seven decades in the region The stadium has held prominent cricket matches – including two one-day internationals – as well as historic political gatherings in the last 35 years. The first ODI match there was held in October 1983 between the West Indies and India, but was marred with protests when residents hooted and cheered for the West Indies. Some locals also dug up the pitch during the lunch break. The second international match was played in 1986 between India and Australia where locals cheered for Australia, who won the match. Even amid itspassion for the sport, Kashmir has failed to produce many top cricketers – except for the few such as Parvez Rasool and Umran Malik – which experts blame on the lack of infrastructure and opportunities. There are many youngsters like high-school student Sameer Farooq, 17, who face challenges and hardships to keep their passion going for the game. Every day Farooq, from Sursyar village in the central district of Budgam, makes a three-hour round trip to practise in Srinagar, which has better facilities. The round trip costs $2.60; a big expense for his family, as his father earns just $9 a day as a labourer. “My family is poor and I [often] can’t afford to travel for cricket training or buy a kit. But I am very passionate and believe that good players emerge from small homes,” said Farooq, whose favourite cricketer is Indian starVirat Kohli. The passion for cricket is no less ardent among the region’s young women. Armeen Riyaz, 20, who grew up playing cricket with her brother in the streets of Srinagar, home to some 1.4 million residents, practises daily at the local cricket academy. “When I walk carrying the cricket kit, people think I am wasting my life. But my family supports me,” she says adding, that she dreams of playing in the Indian women’s cricket team.       Meanwhile, the hosting of the World Cup in India also means business for Kashmir’s famedcricket bat manufacturers. Faizan Mir, 28, who owns a bat manufacturing unit in the outskirts of Srinagar’s Pampore area, says that if India win the World Cup, it will boost his sales as the demand for the bats rises in Indian markets. “There is a lot of enthusiasm about cricket in India. The sales have already gone up due to the World Cup but if India wins, the sales will triple,” said Mir, who runs a bats and clefts manufacturing company Enrival. Mir hopes that international matches return to Kashmir. “I hope the big matches are also played in Kashmir, too.” On Saturday, at a cafe on the banks of Dal Lake in Srinagar, Indian tourists and local residents were watching theIndia vs Pakistan matchtogether. But there was little excitement from the fans of the Pakistan cricket team due to their poor performance. With the Pakistani team managing a meagre 192-all out after batting first, Kashmiri fans were largely watching the match in silence. “Pakistan are always unpredictable. This time they played really bad,” said Shameem, a Pakistan fan who came to the cafe with her son. “They [Pakistan team] spoiled our mood … we will go outside and relax. India played really well.” However, tourists supporting the Indian team were cheering every ball that Indian captain Rohit Sharma hit. “We knew our team would bash them [the Pakistan team],” Mahesh Kumar, a tourist from the state of Uttar Pradesh, said, just before India saw out a seven-wicket victory. “This is a double treat to watch.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Afghanistan created another big upset at the Cricket World Cup as theythumped struggling Pakistanby eight wickets to win two games at the same edition of the tournament for the first time. Afterstunning Englandeight days ago, the ninth-ranked Afghans celebrated only their third-ever win at the World Cup on Monday, the other coming against Scotland in 2015 in their first appearance. An aggressive 130-run opening stand between Ibrahim Zadran (87) and Rahmanullah Gurbaz (65) orchestrated Afghanistan’s 286-2 in 49 overs against out-of-sort Pakistan’s pace and spin bowling. Rahmat Shah and captain Hashmatullah Shahidi built on the solid first-wicket stand by sharing an unbeaten 96-run third-wicket stand. Shah remained unbeaten on 77 while Shahidi scored 48 not out as he raised the victory with a boundary against Shaheen Afridi at square leg. Pakistan, which won the toss and elected to bat, made 282-7 against a spin-heavy quartet with captain Babar Azam (74) and Abdullah Shafique (58) scoring half-centuries. It was Pakistan’s first loss in a one-day international (ODI) against Afghanistan, which bettered its previous highest successful ODI chase of 274 made against the United Arab Emirates nine years ago. “The way we chased today was very professional,” Shahidi said in his post-match interview. We will try our best to play positive cricket, and do a lot for our country … The game was in our hands from the beginning until the end.”  Azam rued Pakistan’s failure to take wickets in the middle overs after setting a decent total. “In a World Cup, if you are not good even in one department, you lose. We started well while bowling, but we couldn’t take wickets,” Azam said in his post-match interview. “All credit to Afghanistan. We are not playing good cricket, [especially] in bowling and fielding … There was no pressure on their batsmen.” A third successive defeat pushed Pakistan into a must-win situation for a place in the semifinals with only four points from five matches. Afghanistan also kept their slim hopes alive with four points in as many games as they moved into the number six spot, behind Pakistan on net run-rate, leaving England at the bottom of the table. The top four teams out of 10 in the round-robin stage qualify for the semifinals.           Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Afghanistan’s Taliban government has urged Pakistan to give undocumented Afghans in the country more time to leave as pressure mounts at border posts where thousands of returnees have gathered, fleeing the threat of deportation. The Pakistani government has given 1.7 million undocumented Afghans in the country until November 1 to leave voluntarily or be forcibly removed. More than 130,000 people have left Pakistansince the order was given at the start of October, according to Pakistani border officials, creatingbottlenecks on either side of crossing points. Taliban authorities thanked Pakistan and other countries that have hosted millions of Afghans who fled during decades of conflict. However, in a statement late on Tuesday, they also “asked them to not forcibly deport Afghans with little notice but to give them time to prepare”.      Tens of thousands leave Pakistan has said it will begin an effort on Thursday to round up and expel anyone still in the country, after setting the deadline in October to begin expelling all undocumented immigrants, including hundreds of thousands of Afghans. A senior official in the northwest province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bordering Afghanistan said about 104,000 Afghan nationals had left through the main Torkham border crossing during the last two weeks. “Some of them have been living in Pakistan for more than 30 years without any proof of registration,” said Nasir Khan, the deputy commissioner of the area. An as yet undetermined number have also left via the Chaman border crossing in the southwestern province of Balochistan. Pakistan’s interior ministry said 140,322 of those who had stayed without documents had left. “A process to arrest the foreigners … for deportation has started by November 1,” it said in a statement, adding that voluntary return would still be encouraged. Of the more than four million Afghans living in Pakistan, the government estimates 1.7 million are undocumented. Regional tensions Since taking power, the Taliban government has urged Afghans to return home but has also condemned Pakistan’s actions, saying nationals are being punished for tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan has said the deportations are to protect its “welfare and security” after a sharp rise in attacks, which the government blames on armed groups operating from Afghanistan. The Taliban has rejected the claim, saying, “In countries where Afghans live, they have not threatened the security of those countries, nor have they been the cause of instability.” The statement criticised Pakistan for restrictions on what Afghans could bring across the border, including property, such as livestock and cash. Border officials on the Afghan side at the Torkham crossing in eastern Afghanistan said they were facing an “emergency situation” as they tried to keep up with thousands of arrivals. An ad hoc settlement has sprung up near the border post, where people sleep outdoors with limited access to food, water and medicines as they wait for registration. The government has established a high commission to address the issue and said two temporary camps would be set up in the area near Torkham. Wednesday’s statement also urged wealthy Afghans to work with the high commission to support returnees with transport, accommodation and shelter. Officials have said staff, technical reinforcements and trucks carrying mobile toilets, generators and water tankers were being deployed to Torkham. A high-level government delegation visited Torkham on Tuesday, pledging support to returnees who had been “forcibly evicted by the Pakistani government against all the norms, good neighbourliness and humanitarian sentiments”.

India steamrollered Pakistan byseven wicketsin a lopsided blockbuster match at a heaving Narendra Modi Stadium to maintain their unblemished 50-overs World Cup record against their archrivals. The western Indian city had been in the grip of cricket fever ahead of the tournament’s most anticipated match on Saturday, and India got themselves in the driving seat early by bundling out their opponents for 191 inside 43 overs. With Babar Azam (50) and Muhammad Rizwan (49) in the middle, a total of about 300 looked within Pakistan’s reach, only for them to collapse in a heap, failing to last their full 50 overs. India’s skipper Rohit Sharma led the chase with a blistering 86, and the two-time champions eventually romped home in 30.3 overs to maintain their unbeaten record against Pakistan in the history of the tournament. They also joined 2019 runners-up New Zealand as the only two teams to win their first three matches in the tournament so far. Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah was player of the match with figures of 2-19 off nine overs. Rohit hit the ball to all parts of the ground with his delightful flicks and pulls to entertain an almost all-Indian crowd at the world’s biggest cricket stadium after Pakistanis were effectivelybanned from attending. India lost Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli – both for 16 – before Rohit and Shreyas Iyer, who hit the winning four to reach 53, put on 77 runs for the third wicket and placed India comfortably on course for victory. Rohit fell attempting another hit off Shaheen Shah Afridi to get caught at mid-wicket, but Iyer and KL Rahul took the team home with ease. Bowlers set up victory after India elected to field and Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja took two wickets each. Pakistan were bowled out in 42.5 overs, losing eight wickets for 36 runs in 80 balls. They now have two wins and one defeat in the 10-nation tournament.      The total was Pakistan’s third lowest against India in the World Cup after their 173 in Sydney (1992) and 180 at Manchester (1999). Pakistan started strongly but lost their openers before skipper Azam and Rizwan attempted to rebuild and hit back in their stand of 82. Azam reached his 50 off 57 balls with a boundary but fell in the next over, bowled by Siraj as the crowd roared to see the back of the world’s number-one ODI batsman. Yadav soon struck twice in an over to send back the left-handed Saud Shakeel and Iftikhar Ahmed, bowled around the legs for four after the ball deflected off the batsman’s gloves. Bumrah denied Rizwan his 50 with a slower-off cutter that rattled the stumps as Pakistan slipped to 168-6. Playing in front of his home crowd, Bumrah had a spring in his step and struck again in the next over to get Shadab Khan out for two before Pandya and Jadeja combined to wrap up the tail. “You try to analyse the wicket as soon as possible so when we started bowling, we came to know that the wicket was on the slower side and a hard length would make run-scoring more difficult,” Bumrah said after the match. “There was no consistent turn but it was turning a little bit and I count my slower ball as a spinner so I thought it might be an option. I was trying to do that and it gripped – it was one of those days.” Pakistan captain Babar rued his side’s batting collapse. “We started well. We had a good partnership [with Rizwan]. We planned to play normal cricket and build a partnership. Suddenly we had a collapse in the middle overs, and we didn’t finish well. “With the new ball we were not up to the mark. If we were it might have been a different situation. If we took early wickets, we could have won the match.” The hotly-anticipated match raised enormous interest, with city hotels booked and desperate fans even booking full-body checkups at local hospitals to be sure of a place to sleep. A prominent hotel in the city usually charges 6,000 rupees ($72) for a deluxe room, but on Friday, Saturday and Sunday the price for a day had been hiked to 70,000 rupees ($841). Only a trickle of Pakistanis, many expatriates, made it to the game after fans from across the borderendured visa delays.          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

India and Pakistanrenew theirrivalrywhen they meet for their ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 clash at theNarendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Both teams go into Saturday’s match having won their two opening matches of the 50-over showpiece event. Pakistan would be forgiven for feeling like gladiators thrown into the Colosseum when they face an India team egged on by 100,000-plus fans, but skipper Babar Azam sees the match as a chance to end a jinx when they play their archrivals. Here’s all you need to know about the match: It’s India vs Pakistan on Saturday at 2pm (08:30 GMT) at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. In One-Day Internationals, the head-to-head record favours Pakistan with 73 wins against India’s 56. When it comes to Cricket World Cup history, the scale is heavily tilted in India’s favour. Pakistan haveneverbeaten India in the ICC ODI World Cup in their seven meetings. India’s captain, Rohit Sharma, who has often spoken about shutting out the outside noise for a big game, said the team’s focus remains on playing a quality opposition and not on records. “Yes, it’s a massive game. But for us, what is important is we are playing a quality opposition tomorrow,” he said on Friday. Rohit said his team weren’t favourites, neither were they underdogs, but they have “momentum” after two wins. “We’ve got to play good cricket on that particular day to win the game, and that is what we will be focusing on.” All in readiness for#INDvPAK😃👌🏻#TeamIndia|#CWC23|#MeninBluepic.twitter.com/sSvHS3xESB — BCCI (@BCCI)October 13, 2023  Defiant Pakistan captain Babar Azam has declared ahead of the match that “records are meant to be broken”. “I don’t focus on the past. Let’s focus on the thing to come as we know records are meant to be broken.” Like India, Pakistan too have two wins from two matchs at the World Cup after seeing off the Netherlands and Sri Lanka. Azam said he has told his players that the clash inside the 132,000-capacity Ahmedabad stadium is a “golden opportunity” to write their names into World Cup folklore. “The India-Pakistan match is a big game, high intensity. I have told [the players] it’s the best opportunity to perform. It is a big stadium that can accommodate many fans. It’s a golden opportunity for us to perform in front of these fans.” Getting game ready in Ahmedabad 🏟️#INDvPAK|#DattKePakistani|#WeHaveWeWillpic.twitter.com/OpC57dCzOK — Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB)October 13, 2023  Opener Shubman Gill, who missed the Australia and Afghanistan games because of dengue fever, has rejoined the team in Ahmedabad, and Gill is “99 percent available to play”, according to his captain. India will also toy with the idea of bringing back off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s batting change against Sri Lanka worked wonders with Abdullah Shafique scoring a fine century on his World Cup debut. It consigns out-of-form Fakhar Zaman to the bench at least in the short term while also adding strength to the batting lineup that is so dependent on captain Babar Azam and Mohammed Rizwan. Rohit vs Shaheen:Rohit has struggled against Shaheen Shah Afridi’s left-arm pace in a duel that began at the T20 World Cup in 2021 when Shaheen trapped Rohit lbw for a duck in the first over with his pace and swing in Dubai. But Rohit came back prepared when the rivals met in Colombo and remained cautious against the quick despite hitting a six off his first over. Kohli vs Rauf:The stakes were high when Virat Kohli came up against Haris Rauf in a challenging chase at the T20 World Cup in Melbourne last year but Kohli held his nerve to smash Rauf for two sixes to bring the house down at a packed MCG. Kohli later said the sixes were “instinctive”, but it began a great battle with the Pakistan quick. Babar vs Bumrah:Jasprit Bumrah experienced the Pakistan captain’s ability at the last T20 World Cup when Babar took on the Indian attack including Bumrah, a yorker king, with ease. But Bumrah beat Babar on a few occasions in Colombo before Hardik Pandya got the prized wicket. Ticketsfor the match were reportedly sold out within an hour of going on sale a few weeks ago. The organisers released another 14,000 tickets last week, but fans complained that those too disappeared within minutes. A capacity crowd is expected at the cauldron named after India’s prime minister. Tens of thousands of ticket-holders have reached the western Indian city from all over the world and some are even staying overnight in local hospitals, a cheaper option than hotels. Local hospitals have seen a sudden influx of patients booked in for check-ups involving a night’s stay to coincide with the most anticipated match of the World Cup. Several doctors told local media the rush for check-up packages was an ingenious way to find affordable accommodation as hotel costs have soared up to 20-fold ahead of the match. “We have come across some cases of people coming to watch the India-Pakistan match also taking an appointment for health check-ups and staying in hospitals,” said Tushar Patel, president of the Ahmedabad Medical Association. Cricket fans were left befuddled when the tournament got under way last week without the fanfare of a colourful opening ceremony. However, in an equally surprising move, Indian cricket officials have announced a star-studded show ahead of Saturday’s match. It has left fans wondering why a mid-tournament match is being accorded more importance than the tournament opener. There’s more to a World Cup than an India Pak matchThat’s why it’s called a WORLD CUP So there’s NO opening ceremony for the first game of the tournament but here we are doing a song & dance technically for a league match I mean, seriously now…!!!https://t.co/pjiu1nVn5J — atul kasbekar (@atulkasbekar)October 13, 2023           Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Mohammad Rizwan and Abdullah Shafique hit centuries asPakistan defeated Sri Lankaby six wickets in a recordCricket World Cuprun chase. Pakistan chased down a target of 345 in 48.2 overs on Tuesday, with Rizwan scoring an undefeated 131 and Shafique making 113 to better the previous successful chase of 328 set by Ireland when they stunned England at the 2011 World Cup. Earlier, Kusal Mendis smashed the fastest century for Sri Lanka in a World Cup match on his way to 122 while Sadeera Samarawickrama hit an 89-ball 108. Pakistan stretched its Cricket World Cup record against Sri Lanka to 8-0 and now has four points from two victories after beating both the qualifiers – the Netherlands and Sri Lanka – going into the marquee game against archrivals India in Ahmedabad on Saturday. Sri Lanka have had plenty of bowling problems at the World Cup, and also lost their opening game against South Africa, who scored 428 runs against the Sri Lankans. The hundreds from Shafique and Rizwan, who hit eight fours and three sixes, overshadowed Mendis’s 77-ball 122 and Samarawickrama’s 108 – maiden ODI hundreds that pushed Sri Lanka’s total to 344-9 on a day when bowlers got walloped from both sides on a perfect batting pitch. Mendis and Samarawickrama showed plenty of aggression in the middle overs with a 111-run third-wicket stand off 69 balls. Mendis capitalised on two early dropped catches inside the powerplay when first off-colour Shaheen Afridi (1-66) could not hold onto a sharp return catch and Imam-ul-Haq dropped a sharp chance at point. Mendis hit 14 fours and six sixes, including a flicked six over mid-wicket against Pakistan’s best bowler of the day – Hasan Ali (4-71) – that brought up his century off 65 balls. Samarawickrama took charge after Mendis holed out to a well-judged catch by Imam at mid-wicket fence. Pakistan pulled back in the final 10 overs despite Samarawickrama raising his century with Haris Rauf (2-64) picking up both his wickets in the final over.  Pakistan had a sluggish start to the chase when Dilshan Madushanka got the key wickets in the powerplay as Imam pulled to fine leg and captain Babar Azam (10) edged a leg-side flick to the wicketkeeper. Shafique and Rizwan then began Pakistan’s second-highest-ever run chase in an ODI as Sri Lankan bowlers like Matheesha Pathirana sprayed plenty of wayward deliveries with slingy action to end up with 1-90. “It’s always a proud memory when you perform for your country,” Rizwan said as he spoke to the media after claiming his player of the match trophy. “It was difficult because when you chase like that it’s always special. When we went to the dressing room every player believed we were going to chase that. This is a team game and we decided to go with a deep partnership.” Sri Lanka’s captain, Dasun Shanaka, tried to remain positive about the performance – especially by his two centurions. “I’m really happy about the way both of the guys played, but we should have finished a bit stronger than this,” he said. “We have to look at the areas we bowled and the number of extras. The only way is to encourage [them]. We had our chances in the field but missed a lot today.”  In the earlier game in Dharamsala, Dawid Malan’s century set up England’s first win of the tournament when they beat Bangladesh by 137 runs. Malan scored 140 off 107 balls – his fifth ODI 100 – as England reached 364-9 to bounce back from losing to New Zealand in the tournament opener. Left-arm pacer Reece Topley returned figures of 4-43 as England bowled out Bangladesh for 227 in 48.2 overs. It was England’s fourth-biggest win by runs in World Cup history. Put in to bat, England made a strong start as Malan and Jonny Bairstow (52) shared 115 runs for the first wicket. Shakib Al Hasan bowled Bairstow, but Malan and Joe Root added 151 runs for the second wicket. Malan hit 16 fours and five sixes overall, and reached his 100 off 91 balls. After the landmark, he cut loose to score 40 off only 16 balls, hitting four fours and three sixes. “It was fantastic to put in a performance like this and win a game [for the team]. Hopefully, my form will continue ahead,” Malan said. “With Root at three, it allows us to play freely. I am desperate to do well in this format and prove a point.” England and Bangladesh, who beat Afghanistan in its opener, both have two points after two games.          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Aiden Markram cracked a crucial half-century as table-topping South Africa broke their 24-year World Cup jinx against Pakistan with anervy one-wicket victoryand inched closer to securing aCricket World Cupsemifinal place with their fifth win in six matches. South Africa began well chasing 271 on Friday as Quinton de Kock (24) and Temba Bavuma (28) landed early blows before Pakistan struck back with timely wickets, but Markram (91) held his nerve to take them close and they eventually got home in 47.2 overs. Usama Mir (2-45) came on as a concussion substitute after Shadab Khan hurt himself fielding and he got rid of Rassie van der Dussen and took a catch to dismiss Heinrich Klaasen while David Miller (29) and Marco Jansen (20) departed after cameos. But the Proteas would not be denied a first victory batting second in the event, despite Markram falling to Usama and Gerald Coetzee to Shaheen Afridi (3-45), as Keshav Maharaj and player of the match Tabraiz Shamsi hung on to settle the tense game. Pakistan fell to their fourth successive defeat as Maharaj hit a four off his legs but Haris Rauf (2-62) nearly won it for them towards the end with a diving catch to send back Lungi Ngidi before number 11 Shamsi survived a review for lbw. “It’s a bit of chaos [in the dressing room] at the moment, the guys are enjoying the moment, guys picking up Shamsi,” said South Africa skipper Bavuma. “Nail-biting finish, if you’re a South African fan, you’re a little bit happier with the outcome. Bavuma said slipping to 250-8 after looking comfortable at one stage was a problem of South Africa’s own making and added that they would need to address their issues. “There’s obviously been pressure with us chasing,” he said. “We haven’t done well to rectify that. We’ll have conversations. It’ll be easier to have those conversations now with the win.” Pakistan were in trouble at 141-5 but Saud Shakeel (52) and Shadab (43) stitched together an 84-run stand with some powerful strokeplay at the MA Chidambaram Stadium to guide the 1992 champions to 270 all out in 46.4 overs. Pakistan were undone at the end by the impressive Shamsi (4-60) and Gerald Coetzee (2-42), who dismissed the in-form pair, as they ultimately fell short of an imposing total when Mohammad Nawaz (24) threw his wicket away.  Pakistan team director Mickey Arthur warned against a “witch-hunt” of his team after their World Cup dream suffered a likely fatal blow. They will have to win their remaining three matches and hope other results go their way if they are to sneak into the semifinals. “They’re going to be blaming everybody, don’t worry. It’s just the way of the world,” said Arthur. “It’s really unfair to start a witch-hunt, certainly on [captain] Babar Azam, on ‘Inzi’ [chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq], on our coaches, on the management team. “What I do know is the boys have tried and the effort of the coaching staff, the effort of the players has been first-class. If they would see that the amount of effort that the players and staff put in, they would be amazed.”      Pakistan, who were ranked as the world’s number top ODI team last month, won their first two games of the tournament. However, they then slumped to defeats against archrivals India, Australia and Afghanistan before going down to the Proteas on Friday. “Very disappointing for all the players,” said Babar. “We fought back but we were 10 to 15 runs short and didn’t finish well. The way fast bowlers and spinners bowled, they fought well but unfortunately, the result was not in our hands. “We had the opportunity to win this match and stay in the tournament but we missed it. We will try our best in our next three matches and put our effort in every match so let’s see where we stand after the three matches.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

It started with deafening boos when Pakistan captain Babar Azam took his turn to speak after the toss in the middle of the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad and carried on long after India had inflicted anotherheavy loss on their neighboursin the ICC Cricket World Cup. The Pakistani cricketers were at the receiving end of incessant hostilities from the crowd during their match against the hosts at the world’s biggest cricket stadium, named after India’s prime minister and leader of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in his hometown. As the match got under way, and with Pakistan fanseffectively bannedby the Indian authorities, the partisan nature of the crowd became evident as any boundary scored by the Pakistani batters was met with pin-drop silence. WhenMuhammad Rizwan– Pakistan’s hero in their run chase against Sri Lanka earlier last week – walked back to the pavilion after his dismissal, the crowd surrounding the walkway mockingly greeted him with chants of “Jai Shri Ram [Hail Lord Ram]”. TheHindi-language chanthas emerged as a war cry by Hindu far-right groups and is often used in a derogatory manner against the country’s Muslim population. Pakistan were dismissed for 191 runs in 42.5 overs, setting an easy target for India’s star-studded batting lineup amid a sea of blue Indian shirts in the stands. India captain Rohit Sharma smashed six sixes and six fours as India eased home, much to the delight of the thousands of supporters seated in the saffron-coloured stands. The jubilant crowd made it a point to add insult to injury and shouted expletive-laden chants when Pakistan stepped on to the field as Sharma and his team made merry on the pitch. Indian sports writer Karthik Krishnawamy termed the crowd’s behaviour “unapologetic Islamophobia” and urged the Pakistan Cricket Board to file a complaint against it. The Indian team didn't raise a complaint when fans at the same venue did this to Shami earlier this year. I hope the PCB complains now because too many Indian fans have gotten away with unapologetic Islamophobia for far too long.https://t.co/PAov7z4TR2 — Karthik Krishnaswamy (@the_kk)October 14, 2023  Veteran cricket writer Kuldip Lal believes the behaviour of the crowd at Ahmedabad, which is home to the Indian prime minister and several BJP leaders, has a lot to do with the stadium’s location. “If there is one venue where you would have such strong anti-Pakistan public sentiment, it’s Ahmedabad,” Lal told Al Jazeera. “In my 30 years of covering cricket, I have never seen such hostility anywhere else in India,” he said. The reception handed out to Pakistan on Saturday was in stark contrast to their previous two matches, which were played in the southern city of Hyderabad. TheHyderabad crowdroared for Babar when he stepped on the field and cheered for Rizwan when he guided his team home with a fighting century. Lal believes locals at some other famous Indian cricket venues, such as Chennai and Bengaluru, have traditionally been better sports fans who appreciate the game instead of putting on an over-zealous display of politics. “The people in Ahmedabad weren’t there to enjoy the match, they had their own political agendas,” he said. Lal, who has visited Pakistan on several occasions since he began covering Indian cricket as a sports journalist in 1982, says he has fond memories of the trips he made with the Indian team. “It has been likewise for Pakistan’s cricketers, fans and journalists who have always been warmly welcomed by Indians whenever they have visited in the past, especially during the last Cricket World Cup that India hosted in 2011,” he recalled. While the jingoistic display on Saturday was cheered by many Indian fans, not all of them appreciated it and distanced themselves from it on social media. “It [the stadium] was built as a political statement. It is used like a political statement,” Gaurav Nandan Tripathi wrote in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. “The audience that comes here [Ahmedabad], think they are free to do these shenanigans because they know it’s all allowed in the saffron den. Politics affects culture.” This is why I hate this stadium. It was built as a political statement. It is used like a political statement. And the audience that comes here, think they are free to do these shenanigans because they know it’s all allowed in the saffron den. Politics affects culture#INDvPAKhttps://t.co/3YuFn3vPXn — Gaurav Nandan Tripathi 🜃 (@Cric_Beyond_Ent)October 14, 2023  Pakistan’s head coach Mickey Arthur took notice of the hostilities and said the match “didn’t seem like an ICC event” and more a part of a bilateral series hosted by the Indian cricket board. “I didn’t hear ‘Dil Dil Pakistan’ coming through the microphones too often tonight,” he said, referring to the Pakistani song that has become an unofficial cricket anthem for the team. “That does play a role. But I’m not going to use that as an excuse [for the loss],” he told reporters after the match. Prior to the match, an Indian travel website tapped into the pre-match hysteria in its tournament advertisement campaign by inviting Pakistani fans to India and offering them various discounts based on their team’s (predicted) loss margins. The campaign was largely slammed in India, but some Indian cricket fans said they wanted “Pakistani fans to come to India” as they enjoyed “watching them lose matches to India”. As an Indian, I want to apologize to every Pakistani person for this@makemytripad. This does not represent Indian values. It only represents the worst among us.

Their next match is against Australia in Bengaluru, where sports writer Lal expects a “sporting crowd” to welcome them. “I hope and pray what we saw in Ahmedabad will not happen again, and I am quite sure it won’t as the crowds in Bengaluru understand and respect sport and sportspersons of all countries.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Pakistan have a proverbial mountain to climb ahead of their crucial ICC Cricket World Cup match against Australia as they battle a viral infection that has gripped several members of the squad and look to pick themselves up after another big loss against rivals India. Babar Azam and his men face the five-time champions Australia on Friday, with star fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi struggling for form and opening batter Abdullah Shafique weakened by a fever. Both Shafique and Afridi rejoined the team in practice at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Wednesday and are available for selection, but questions remain over the 1992 champions’ form going into their fourth match of the tournament. Pakistan won their opening two matches in contrasting style but were handed aseven-wicket lossat the massive Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad last week, where they were subjected tohostile behaviourby thepartisan crowd. The Pakistan Cricket Board has lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council over “inappropriate conduct” towards its players during the match. Azam was booed at the toss while video on social media appeared to show several Pakistan players including Mohammad Rizwan being abused by Indian fans.

The PCB has also filed a complaint regarding inappropriate conduct… — PCB Media (@TheRealPCBMedia)October 17, 2023  The team is now back in the southern part of India, where they will play their remaining seven matches and will hope to garner similar support to their two wins in Hyderabad. TheHyderabad crowd cheeredwhen Shafique and Rizwan scored centuries in Pakistan’s record run chase of 345-4 against Sri Lanka. “Win or lose is part of the game,” said Rizwan, who has scored 248 in three innings. “We have lost to India, but if you see we had also won two matches. We have to match our skills with our game awareness … we can’t say we are behind the world.” Azam, the number-one-ranked batter in one-day-international (ODI) cricket, is yet to get his momentum in the tournament. But more than batting it’s the bowlers who haven’t yet got into any sort of rhythm against good batting sides. Afridi has struggled to pick up early wickets, while Haris Rauf and Hasan Ali have performed in patches. Spinners Shadab Khan and Mohammad Nawaz struggled to give Pakistan breakthroughs in the middle overs. Pakistan legend Waqar Younis advised Afridi to learn from India seamer Jasprit Bumrah if he wants to make an impact at the World Cup. Afridi is struggling with his pace and fitness and has been unimpressive in all three games at the World Cup where his four wickets have come at a cost of 139 runs. “I don’t know if there is a problem with his fitness,” Waqar said after the loss against India. “The missing link in his bowling is discipline and he is over trying to get wickets. “When you do the same thing again and again, like Shaheen is bowling to get his yorker going, then batsmen know that and they are ready for it.” Waqar said Pakistan’s bowling “lacks discipline” at the World Cup where three games have yielded two wins and one loss. But Rizwan has backed his bowlers to come good. “Everyone is saying we are unpredictable but I believe we have the world’s top bowlers,” Rizwan said. Pakistan and Australia have met on 10 occasions, and while Pakistan have won four matches, the losses inflicted by Australia have been big and impactful. Australia began their resurgence in the tournament by bundling out Pakistan for 132 in the 1999 Cricket World Cup final at Lord’s Cricket Ground. They chased the target in 29.5 overs for the loss of two wickets. They also beat Pakistan in the 2015 tournament en route to winning the title at home and in 2019 once again, their sixth Cricket World Cup win over the team in green. Australia will look to build on theirfirst win of the tournament. But to set Australia firmly back in contention, they need the established top-order batters to get going with the likes of David Warner and Steven Smith taking more responsibility. Warner has scores of 41, 13 and 11 in three games while Smith has scored 65 in three knocks that included a duck against Sri Lanka. Australia captain Pat Cummins managed to get just one wicket in the first two matches, prompting former skipper Michael Clarke to predict on domestic radio that Cummins was set to sit on the bench in the game against Sri Lanka. But the captain responded by taking two vital wickets against Sri Lanka before Adam Zampa spun the team to a five-wicket win. Pakistan have traditionally not dealt well with Australian pacers and struggled against India’s top bowler Bumrah. Azam admitted his middle-order batters let him down against India. “The way we started, we were targeting 280 or 290 but the collapse cost us so our total is not good,” he said. Injured and out-of-favour opener Fakhar Zaman is back in contention for Friday, as Pakistan look to get past their slow batting starts. Rizwan said his team was looking forward to the Australia challenge. “We haven’t lost our spirits after one loss.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Australia lost their first two matches without crossing 200 runs, butwon their last game against Sri Lankato move up to seventh in the standings. However, their top order has failed to get going despite some promising starts. Marnus Labuschagne is the only Australia batter to score more than 100 runs in the tournament so far, and Cummins said it was important they stepped up in Bengaluru, where the team batting first has averaged 335 in the last three one-day internationals (ODI). “Especially at a venue like here in Bangalore, I dare say it’s going to be high-scoring, smaller field. The pitch is always really good here,” Cummins told reporters ahead of Friday’s game. “Batting is super important. I think the way the guys started the last game really set the tone – Mitchell [Marsh] and Davey [Warner] up front from the first over, taking the game on. “That’s what we want from our players. And they’re working really hard, they’re doing all the right things. I’m sure plenty of runs are around the corner.” Pakistan started the tournament with two winsbefore losing to Indiaand they sit fourth in the standings. Both sides will renew their decades-long World Cup rivalry. Cummins said the Asian side are “well-structured”, identifying Mohammad Rizwan and captain Babar Azam as their biggest batting threats while Hasan Ali has been the pick of Pakistan’s fast bowlers with seven wickets. “They have some really good quick bowlers who can do some damage, some spin bowlers that can bowl 20 of their overs,” Cummins said. “Rizwan’s the leading run scorer, Babar Azam’s always good, a couple of other batters that have scored a lot in ODIs lately.

On Saturday, Pakistan will play India in aCricket World Cupgame that might go down as the most-watched cricket broadcast in history and some tickets on the black market are selling foras much as $300,000. But whether any Pakistan fans will be allowed into the country, let alone the stadium, seems increasingly unlikely. Either way, the rivalry remains thebiggest in cricket– despite the fact that India last toured Pakistan in 2006 and the two have not played a bilateral series for more than a decade. Yet, there was a time, the nostalgists will tell you, when cricket united the two neighbours rather than divided them. The term “cricket diplomacy” was first widely used in 1987 when President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan made a surprise visit to India to watch a test match between the two countries. The visit came at a time of heightened tension overKashmir– the issue behind two of the three wars between the countries – and was part of Zia’s “cricket for peace” initiative. During a dull moment in the action, however, Zia allegedly mentioned to Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi that Pakistan had a nuclear bomb. The border tensions would soon return. Perhaps their most successful period of cricket diplomacy came between 2003 and 2008 – a time in which two test series were played in Pakistan and two in India. The on-field bonhomie reflected, in many ways, the warm relationship between Pakistani PresidentPervez Musharraf(who was born in present-day India) and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (who was born in present-day Pakistan). But things came crashing down in November 2008 when gunmen with links to a Pakistani armed groupkilled more than 160 peoplein Mumbai, India. Relations – both cricketing and political – have beentense ever since, with Kashmir remaining the hot-button topic. “When relationships between India and Pakistan are good, cricket is the first vehicle for them to express themselves,” Osman Samiuddin, a senior editor at ESPNCricinfo and author of The Unquiet Ones – A History of Pakistan Cricket, told Al Jazeera. “But when the going’s bad, cricket is often used as an exclusionary power tool.” Samiuddin acknowledges the role cricket can play in high-level bilateral diplomacy. “It’s not often that leaders of India and Pakistan get together for any reason and they often find that cricket is the one language they both understand,” he said, adding that any diplomatic overtures “have to be okayed at a political level first”.  Last December, India’s foreign minister called Pakistan the “epicentre of terrorism”, while his counterpart responded by calling India’s Hindu-nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi the“butcher of Gujarat”, referring to his time as chief minister of the state during riots in 2002 that killed nearly 2,000 people – most of them Muslims. Neither Samiuddin nor Emily Crick, a United Kingdom-based academic who has published extensively on cricket diplomacy, sees a swift way back from the current impasse. “With Narendra Modi as PM of India nothing is going to change,” Crick said. “There is no desire on his side to make peace … [and] Pakistan are too caught up in their own stuff to worry about India.” Samiuddin agrees with that assessment of high-level relations. But he says the diplomatic freeze also has a lot to do with economic changes in the two countries. “There was a time when India playing Pakistan was the biggest money-spinner for both boards,” he said, but for India – currently the world’s fifth-largest economy – those days are long gone. TheIndian Premier Leagueis one of the most lucrative sports leagues in the world so there’s much less economic incentive to play Pakistan in any format, let alone test matches. Even Pakistan, with all itseconomic problems, has found a way to make domestic franchise cricket work financially. “Pakistan stands to gain more from a resumption in cricketing relations,” Samiuddin said. “But neither side has to make it work.” While the power imbalance has become more marked in recent years, Crick’s research shows that both sides have long known that India holds most of the trump cards. This is why Pakistani leaders have tried to use cricket matches to force high-level unofficial meetings with their Indian counterparts. India, meanwhile, has typically used cricket as a form of diplomatic sanction – with many Indian politicians stating that cricket cannot be played as long as Pakistan supports the armed uprising in Kashmir.      Of course, cricket diplomacy is not only about relations between India and Pakistan. In the mid-1990s, India and Pakistanstood with Sri Lankaby sending tours to the country when other teams refused to visit due to the continuing civil war. And in 2008 the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that Zimbabwe would not be allowed to tour England due to the human rights violations of what then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown referred to as Robert Mugabe’s “criminal cabal”. But perhaps the most obvious example of cricket’s power as anexclusionary tooldates back to apartheid South Africa. As André Odendaal – author of several books on the history of South African cricket – explains, cricket had always been closely linked to the power structures in South Africa; whether imperial, financial, or political. That changed in 1968 when the D’Oliveira affair “ruptured the comfort of the old boys’ club of Empire,” he says. Born in Cape Town in 1931,Basil D’Oliveira– of Indian and Portuguese ancestry – was universally accepted as the best South African player of colour of his generation. But the colour of his skin meant he could never be selected to represent his country. Thanks to donations from his community he emigrated to Britain in the early 1960s and within a few years he was playing for England. With England due to tour South Africa in 1968, the apartheid government and cricket association made it clear to England’s cricket administrators and other friends in high places that D’Oliveira would not be welcome in the country of his birth. “The two establishments did what they had always done,” Odendaal said. “It was another case of ‘wink, wink, we’ll sort it out.’” The powers-that-be in England and South Africa hatched a plan which, they hoped, would allow them to sidestep the issue. Despite having scored 87 not out in the first Ashes test against Australia in 1968, Dolly was dropped from the England team. Four matches later, with England still trailing 1-0, a spate of injuries resulted in D’Oliveira being recalled. He batted like a man whose career depended on it and scored a magnificent 158 that helped England square the series. When the English selectors stuck with their plan and left him out of the squad to tour South Africa, “the public saw through the facade,” Odendaal said, and it prompted protests and several Marylebone Cricket Club members resigned. “It was just so obviously unfair.”      After the bowler Tom Cartwright pulled out of the tour due to injury, the selectors felt compelled to replace him with D’Oliveira – a batting allrounder. Now it was the South African government’s turn to be outraged. Prime Minister BJ Vorster described the England team as “not the team of the MCC but the team of the anti-apartheid movement” and made it clear that a mixed-race England would not be allowed to play in South Africa. The tour was cancelled and South Africa was soon frozen out of international cricket until 1991. The D’Oliveira affair was, Odendaal says, “the dynamite that ignited the sports boycott of apartheid South Africa” – a boycott that would play a major role in bringing the apartheid government to its knees. While members of the old colonial political establishments, in South Africa and internationally, tried to insist that sports and politics should be kept separate, this was out of sync with a widespread appetite for decolonisation. Odendaal describes the anti-apartheid movement as “one of the two biggest single-issue campaigns in the second half of the 20th century,” – the other being the anti-nuclear movement – but he’s not sure the same tactics would be as effective in today’s world. “Sport today is not so much about government control as about mega money,” he said. “Just look at what’s happening withSaudi Arabiaandsportswashing in golfand soccer with the Olympics likely to follow.”      Even if all of the experts Al Jazeera spoke to agree that “cricket diplomacy” is either dead or comatose, as a high-level political tool, this ignores the immense potential cricket has for “people-to-people” diplomacy. Crick, an avid England supporter, has experienced this on tours to Pakistan in 2005 and 2022. On both occasions, she was wowed by the generosity of the Pakistani people who were “so happy that we had come”. “They were really conscious of trying to make it the best possible trip for us. I think they saw it as a way of portraying a different view of Pakistan,” she said. “It wasn’t diplomacy on a high level, but on a people-people front.” Similar things have happened every time India or Pakistan have relaxed visa restrictions to allow each other’s citizens to watch cricket matches. Even in today’s strained political climate, Samiuddin is hopeful that some good can come of Pakistan’s participation in this year’s World Cup. “Only two members of the Pakistan squad have toured India before,” he pointed out. And with Pakistan playing games in five different cities, there will definitely be “some kind of benefit from Indian people seeing them up close in hotels and stadiums and realising they are just regular human beings”.

More than 33 million people were directly affected, with a staggering 20.6 million requiring urgent humanitarian assistance. The consequences were dire – nearly eight million people were displaced and at least two million houses destroyed. Although the water has receded, a year later, the scars of the catastrophe remain fresh. At least 1.5 million people are still displaced. Basic necessities, such as food and shelter, continue to be out of reach for a large portion of the flood-affected population, with more than 40 percent of them relying on humanitarian aid for survival. While the immediate concerns of food, shelter and water have been largely addressed, climate anxiety among the flood-affected communities across Pakistan has failed to make headlines. Although climate anxiety is a newly coined term, it reflects a distress that has long been felt by these communities. Amid the increasing threat of climate change, floods in Pakistan have grown more frequent, resulting in some communities facing an unending cycle of displacement and despair. For these communities, the fatigue caused by climate-induced disasters has begun to take its toll. They are not only exhausted but also more anxious than ever about the potential threat of cascading disasters. Residents in these flood-affected areas are living in fear of an uncertain future. They grapple with the harsh reality that they lack the necessary preparations to face another flood, and they have no clear plans for shelter should their already fragile homes become uninhabitable. Despite contributing very little to the global climate crisis, Pakistan remains one of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. And climate anxiety will likely continue to rise in the country, especially among the most vulnerable populations. Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Islamabad, Pakistan– Thousands of Afghan refugees and migrants in Pakistan areheading to the borderto return home a day before a government-imposed deadline to leave the country expires. Earlier this month, Pakistan’s interim interior minister, Sarfaraz Bugti, issued an October 31 deadline for all “illegal” refugees and migrants to leave,citing security concerns. The government says more than four million foreigners live in Pakistan, a vast majority of them Afghan nationals who sought refuge over the last four decades after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. More recently, after the Taliban regained power in 2021, Pakistani officials say between 600,000 to 800,000 Afghans migrated to Pakistan. The Pakistani government claims nearly 1.7 million of those Afghans are undocumented. Local media reports on Tuesday said nearly 100,000 Afghan immigrants have voluntarily gone back to their country from Torkham border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Chaman crossing in Balochistan provinces this month. Bugti on Monday denied the repatriation drive was targeted against the Afghans. “Most of the undocumented people are from Afghanistan, and the impression that only people from Afghanistan are being evicted is wrong,” he told a news conference. The government is also setting updeportation centresin all four provinces to detain foreigners until they are sent back. Rights groups and the United Nations have slammed Pakistan’s decision to evict the refugees. The deportation order came during a dramatic surge in armed attacks in Pakistan, which the government blames on Afghanistan-based groups and nationals, allegations denied by the Afghan Taliban. “There have been 24 suicide bomb attacks since January this year and 14 of them were carried out by Afghan nationals,” Bugti said on October 3 when he announced the repatriation plan. Pakistan has reported more than 300 attacks this year, mainly in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces bordering Afghanistan.      Adeela Akhtar, an Afghan refugee in Rawalpindi, told Al Jazeera she had “no idea what tomorrow [Wednesday] will bring” for her. “If the police come to my door tomorrow, I will plead with them, implore them to let me stay. I cannot go back, but I don’t know how else to convince them to let me stay here,” said the 47-year-old widow and a mother of two children. Akhtar, a former school teacher in Kabul, moved to Pakistan 18 months ago after the Taliban took over as she feared for her safety. She said she applied for the Pakistani visa and made multiple visits to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office for securing documentation to facilitate her stay, but did not get any help. “I have two children living here with me and I don’t want to put their lives in danger again,” she said. Asad Khan, an Islamabad-based lawyer who provides legal aid to Afghan refugees, criticised the government’s move, saying it violated their fundamental rights. “Pakistan’s constitution guarantees the dignity of man, and the same applies to refugees, too. We can say that under certain international laws, which have been ratified by Pakistan, sending these people back is illegal,” he told Al Jazeera. Khan said removing Afghans who had been living in Pakistan for many years – and even decades – would be “deeply disruptive” to their lives. “They have built homes, families and livelihoods here in Pakistan and now returning to Afghanistan surely poses significant challenges for them. The security situation in Afghanistan remains uncertain, economic opportunities are scarce, and access to essential services like healthcare and education is limited,” he said. “Above all, the psychological toll of returning to a war-torn country cannot be understated. It is imperative that any such policy carefully considers the wellbeing and safety of these refugees and adheres to international obligations to protect vulnerable populations.” In a statement on Tuesday, Human Rights Watch condemnedPakistan’s decisionand said the government was using “threats, abuse, and detention to coerce Afghan asylum seekers without legal status to return to Afghanistan or face deportation”. “Pakistan’s announced deadline for Afghans to return has led to detentions, beatings, and extortion, leaving thousands of Afghans in fear over their future,” said Fereshta Abbasi, the Afghanistan researcher at HRW. “The situation in Afghanistan remains dangerous for many who fled, and deportation will expose them to significant security risks, including threats to their lives and well-being.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

A Pakistani court has indicted Imran Khan for leaking state secrets, according to reports. The charge adds to the huge volume of legal turmoil that the former prime minister has met since hisremoval in April 2022. “He has been indicted today and the charge was openly read out,” said Shah Khawar of the Federal Investigation Agency outside Adiala Jail in Islamabad, where Khan is imprisoned, Pakistani broadcaster Geo TV reported on Monday. Khan’s former deputy, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, has also been indicted in the state secrets case. A spokesperson for Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e Insaf (PTI) party said the men were charged under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act in a closed-door trial, adding the ruling would be “challenged”. Khan, who led Pakistan from August 2018 to April 2022, is charged with leaking a diplomatic letter between Washington and Islamabad that he says points to the role of the United States in forcing him out of office. The US and Pakistan have denied the claim. Khan, a former cricket star turned politician who has a large grassroots following in the South Asian state, wasdeposedby a no-confidence vote in parliament in April 2022 over accusations of economic mismanagement. His downfall came after he fell out with the country’s powerful military establishment and tried to dissolve parliament, an act the country’s Supreme Court ruled was unconstitutional. He has since faced a slew of criminal charges — in cases ranging from terrorism to contempt of court to blasphemy. Despite his removal — and the criminal accusations — Khan has retained huge popular support. After he was brieflyjailedin May 2023, his supporterstook to the streetsin nationwide protests that sometimes erupted into violence. Pakistan’s military responded with a fierce crackdown, rounding up thousands of Khan’s supporters and forcing almost the entire PTI leadership underground. Many have sinceleft the party. In August, Khan was convicted of corruption and sentenced to three years in jail. While that charge was latersuspended, he has remained behind bars pending the court ruling on his state secret charge. He is also barred from running in upcoming elections in January 2024. Khan’s latest indictment for leaking confidential information carries a far more severe penalty of 14 years imprisonment, and in extreme cases, the death penalty, his lawyers say. From jail, Khan has said he is “stronger than ever” and lashed out at his opponents who he says are seeking to push him out of the political scene for good. Chairman Imran Khan's message to the people of Pakistan shared through his family on the 10th of October: “When I was illegally incarcerated in Attock Jail, the first few days were particularly challenging. I wasn’t provided a bed and had to sleep on the floor and had insects… — Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI)October 12, 2023  “Do not give up,” Khan told his supporters in a statement earlier this month.” Keep raising your voice against this unelected predatory group and their facilitators at every forum and keep demanding a fair and transparent election in the country.” On Saturday, Khan’s main political rival, three-time former premier Nawaz Sharif,returnedto Pakistan, ending four years of self-imposed exile as he attempts a comeback bid in the January 2024 elections. While Sharif is also barred from participating in elections, analysts believe legal hurdles are likely beingremovedas part of a backroom deal between his party and the army.

It is cricket’s fiercest rivalry, watched by millions, sparking raucous celebrations in victory and wild accusations in defeat, but whenever India and Pakistan have clashed at theICC Cricket World Cup, there has been only one winner. India have defeated Pakistan seven times out of seven at the tournament since they first met in Sydney in 1992, a run that Babar Azam’s side will hope to end when they meet the hosts in Ahmedabad on Saturday. Is it luck? Have India benefitted from winning five of the seven tosses? Are Pakistan more susceptible to pressure? “We played seven games and our neighbouring country reminds us every second day about the 7-0,” Pakistan legend Wasim Akram said. “Frankly speaking, I can’t single out one reason for the losing streak.” Inzamam-ul-Haq, who ended up on the losing side for Pakistan on four occasions, believes pressure has been a factor. “Maybe India handled the pressure better than us on the day of the match and winning most of the tosses also gave them an advantage,” he said. Even when Pakistan won the toss twice, their luck did not change. They were outdone by Sachin Tendulkar’s brilliance in the chase at Centurion in South Africa in 2003 and by Rohit Sharma at Manchester in 2019 when India were sent in to bat. The defeat at the 2019 tournament cost Sarfaraz Ahmed the captaincy. Due to a quirk of the playing format, Pakistan and India never met in the first four World Cups. Both were favourites to meet in the final when they were co-hosts in 1987, but each fell in the semis. The first encounter happened in 1992 at Sydney, a low-scoring affair that was remembered more for Pakistan’s Javed Miandad jumping up and down in a bizarre attempt to mimic India wicketkeeper Kiran More. Pakistan failed to chase a modest 217-run total, losing by 43 runs. However, that defeat was soon forgotten when Imran Khan’s team staged a remarkable recovery to win their first and only 50-over World Cup title. Four years later, Pakistan lost again by 39 runs in India’s backyard in Bangalore. The defeat resulted in a furious reaction back home – skipper Wasim Akram was even alleged to have feigned injury. “It was hellish,” recalls Akram. “No one digested that defeat and we had to return home under tight security and couldn’t go out of our homes for days.” At the 1999 World Cup, Akram and his team were subjected to a match-fixing inquiry after they lost by 47 runs to India and slumped to a shock loss to Bangladesh. They still managed to finish as runners-up. Despite boasting an intimidating three-pronged pace attack of Akram, Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar, Pakistan lost their 2003 World Cup encounter by six wickets. A high-profile semifinal also went to India by 29 runs in Mohali in 2011, a match where respective prime ministers Manmohan Singh of India and Yousuf Raza Gillani of Pakistan watched from the stands. “To be honest, I don’t know the reason why we always lost,” Shahid Afridi, the skipper in 2011, said. “We played so well to reach the semifinals and fell short in Mohali. I also heard some silly things but it was a matter of respect and as captain I told my players to give their best.” A packed house in Adelaide saw Virat Kohli’s century subdue Pakistan by 76 runs in the 2015 World Cup. Pakistan once again fell short in 2019, again in Manchester, as they lost by 83 runs in a rain-hit game. So can it be eighth time lucky for Pakistan when they renew their rivalry in Ahmedabad on Saturday at this World Cup? “That jinx will be broken one day and this current Pakistan team is capable of doing that,” said Akram. “We broke the Twenty20 World Cup jinx after five defeats in 2021 in Dubai, so the 50-over jinx can also go.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Pakistan’splan to evicthundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees and migrants is “unacceptable”, says the Taliban, denying Islamabad’s allegations that Afghanistan’s citizens were responsible for Pakistan’s security problems. “The behaviour of Pakistan towards Afghan refugees is unacceptable,” Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesman for the Taliban administration in Kabul, said in a post on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday. “Afghan refugees are not involved in Pakistan’s security problems. As long as they leave Pakistan voluntarily, that country should tolerate them,” he said. Around one million Afghans are registered as refugees in Pakistan and 880,000 more have legal status to remain, according to the latest United Nations figures. But Pakistan’s caretaker government on Tuesday said a further 1.73 million Afghans were living in Pakistan without any legal status, and set a November 1 deadline for them to leave or face expulsion.      In a statement shared with Al Jazeera, rights group Amnesty International on Wednesday urged Pakistan to continue its “historic support” for Afghan refugees by enabling them to live with dignity and free from the fear of deportation to Afghanistan. “They are living incredibly precarious lives where they are either having to undergo arduous processes for registering as refugees in Pakistan; or are stuck in lengthy processes waiting to obtain relocation to another country. A forced return to Afghanistan could put them at grave risk,” it said. Amnesty called on the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to expedite registration and reviews of applications from Afghans seeking international protection in Pakistan and asked Pakistan to stop the crackdown against the refugees. Afghans have migrated to neighbouring Pakistan over decades of conflict during the Soviet invasion, the following civil war and the United States-led occupation. Nearly 600,000 Afghans have arrived since theTaliban seized powerin Kabul in 2021. Taliban authorities have been trying to tempt back those who left, despite the nation suffering from a massive scaleback of aid following the collapse of the US-backed government. To justify its crackdown, Pakistan’s caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti alleged that Afghan nationals had carried out 14 out of 24 suicide bombings in Pakistan this year. The Taliban rejected the charge. “We deny all these claims because Afghans have migrated to other countries for their safety, their security,” said Abdul Mutalib Haqqani, spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation. “It’s natural when someone migrates to another country for his safety, he would never want insecurity there,” he told AFP news agency. Pakistan’s ultimatum to the migrants, most of whom have been living in the country for years, came after a meeting of civil and military leaders to review the law-and-order situation following two suicide bombings on Friday that killed at least 57 people. Bugti said one of the suicide bombers was an Afghan national, and he also accused India’s intelligence agency of involvement. Relations between the Taliban and the Pakistan government have deteriorated markedly, withborder clashestemporarily closing the main trade route between the neighbours last month. Islamabad alleges that armed groups use Afghan soil to train fighters and plan attacks inside Pakistan. The Taliban denies the accusation, saying Pakistan’s security problems are home-grown. A caretaker government was installed in August to guide Pakistan through to elections expected sometime in the coming months, and the military has been able to exert more influence as a result of the uncertainty and instability in the country.

Manasi Pathak in Mumbai, India –When theCricket World Cup schedulewas announced in June, Indian fans were most excited about one fixture: India vs Pakistan, thebiggest rivalryin the sport. Cricket matches between those neighbouring countries are known for their intensity, with therivalry going well beyond the field. The nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours share a fraught relationship and have fought three wars since 1947 when India was partitioned after independence and Pakistan was created. There has been a sharp deterioration in relationships between the two countries since the2008 attacksin India’s western city of Mumbai, where more than 160 people were killed and a Pakistan-based armed group was named as the suspected mastermind, as well asover Kashmir. Due to political tensions, crossing the border for cricket is a rarity for both teams. Neither team has travelled to the other’s country for a bilateral series since Pakistan’s trip to India for an ODI series in 2012-13. Saturday’s World Cup clash in Ahmedabad’sNarendra Modi Stadium– the world’s largest cricket venue, boasting a 130,000-plus capacity – has thus been billed as the biggest match in recent history as India: the number one ranked ODI team hosting second-ranked Pakistan. Both India and Pakistan head into the match with two World Cup wins in two games. “It’s an epic. You shouldn’t miss this match in a lifetime,” Harish Iyer, an India fan, told Al Jazeera. “It’s a huge pressure game for players but it’s wonderful for fans. You are elated when you see India win, you’re on cloud nine for weeks. But when they lose, it’s extremely upsetting.” The craze among Indians for the highly-anticipated match has been extraordinary, with tickets being sold foras high as $300,000in the resale market, althoughfans in Pakistanhave not been able to get visas to travel. Mahesh Balakrishnan, a local cricket coach in Mumbai, described the game as a “purely temperamental match”. “With India and Pakistan, what comes into the picture is the weight of expectation,” he said. “It’s the pressure that has been built up by the millions of people who are supporting India. Players have to absorb the pressure … whoever has the nerve will win the match.” However, Balakrishnan played down the hype around the political rivalry seeping into cricket. “From what we can see on TV, the India and Pakistan players get along very well. They are very pally. It’s only the media that hype it up for publicity and make it a big issue of it,” he said. Aarush Tiwari, a 12-year-old aspiring cricketer, said he does not sense any feeling of animosity among India and Pakistan players. “They show sportsmanship,” said Tiwari. “Personally, I also look up to Pakistan players for their cricketing qualities.” Muhammad Rizwan, who struck a century in Pakistan’s last game, is a fan favourite among Indians – somebacklash over pro-Gaza commentsnotwithstanding – along with skipper Babar Azam and bowler Haris Rauf. Iyer, though, thinks that Pakistan’s current squad lacks star players. “When you have star players, you have that aura. In the early 2000s, they had many stars who could turn a match around,” he said, referring to former captain Wasim Akram and fast-bowling legend Shoaib Akhtar.   This year’s tournament marks the first time Pakistan have played on Indian soil since the 2016 Twenty20 World Cup. Due to the bitter relations between the countries, the teams usually face each other only in ICC events and the Asia Cup on the international stage. Players from Pakistan have also been shut out of the Indian Premier League, the lucrative T20 franchise tournament, since 2008 following the Mumbai attacks. Iyer said the debate over IPL participation is complicated as “politics takes precedence” in this situation. Youngster Tiwari, though, would enjoy the prospect of Pakistani bowlers playing against Indian batters in the world’s top T20 competition. “It’ll be fun if Pakistanis are allowed to play in the IPL because the league needs more top bowlers, which Pakistan have,” Tiwari said. “They have great fast bowlers and spinners, so if they play, the league’s quality will be even higher.”      Abid Hussain in Islamabad, Pakistan –Pakistani fans have been left to rue the geopolitics which means they are unable to receive visas to attend the match, despite repeated promises by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) that they would be able to do so. However, it still has not dimmed the excitement of many fans about the upcoming match, even if most of them believe India will emerge as the victors. Eman Tufail is a 25-year-old UX strategist by day and a content lead for cricket coverage platform Grassroots Cricket by night, who is based in Karachi, southern Pakistan. She says India’smighty batting and bowlingmakes them a “scary proposition” to play. “I think everybody expects them to do well in the tournament, which is on their home ground, and they were perhaps the most in-form team coming into the World Cup,” she told Al Jazeera.  Anam Nadeem, a 36-year-old cricket writer and a podcast host living in the Pakistani city of Sialkot, says that the Indian cricket team has given Pakistani fans several “heartbreaks” over the years. “We have faced India seven times in 50-overs Cricket World Cup and lost every single one of those matches. It is difficult for an average Pakistani fan to overcome the accumulated trauma caused by the Indian team,” Nadeem told Al Jazeera. The last time two teams played against each other was in the Asia Cup in September, which was scheduled to be hosted in Pakistan but due to BCCI’s insistence, was largely moved to Sri Lanka. After the first-round match was washed out, the second-round match saw India give Pakistan a memorable shellacking, inflicting a 228-run defeat, with former captain Virat Kohli scoring a majestic century. 26-year-old Abdus Saboor, an Islamabad-based dentist, still had bad memories of the match fresh in his mind, as he warmed up with his friends to play a game of indoor cricket. “Look, India-Pakistan games are already so full of pressure and when you have the monkey of 7-0 on your back, it gets difficult to cope,” the dentist told Al Jazeera in between stretches. “If you compare the two teams on paper, India’s individual firepower is so much more than Pakistan’s in both batting and fielding and then they have Kohli. He is a big match player and the kind of track record he has against us, and his ice-cool ability to chase, he can win the match for India single-handedly.” Nadeem felt that the cordial relationships between the teams, and especially thelove shown for Kohli, shows that the players are “more vocal about the warmth and mutual respect they have for each other as athletes”. “The constant political war and the inbuilt hostility in an average Indian or Pakistani blind them from seeing how similar people are from each side of the border,” she added.      Tufail says that the IPL remains a “sore spot” for Pakistani fans as a tournament which prides itself as a “festival of cricket” but does not include Pakistani players. “It is a cruel reminder of how we are not given due importance in world cricket, and nobody even says anything. Journalists you respect, players you like; they all remain quiet. It’s an irrational anger, perhaps, but why doesn’t anybody speak up about this?” she asks. Saboor, the dentist, points out that while not playing in the IPL meant the Pakistani players had no experience with Indian conditions, he blamed the BCCI for excluding Pakistan from the T20 tournament. “On one hand, they want to keep us away from IPL, but on the other, whenever they get a chance, they use our presence for their own gains, like how they are holding a major function before the match on Saturday,” he says, referring to the proposed plan by the BCCI to host a ceremony before the game.

However, these events have become more frequent and severe in recent decades—unprecedented rainfall in 2010 and 2022 caused catastrophic floods and landslides, and a drought at the beginning of the 21st century caused widespread famine.Climate scientists must quantify the influence of natural climate variability on theseextreme weather eventsto understand how and the extent to which climate change has contributed to this increased volatility.The study, titled ""The influence of natural variability on extreme monsoons in Pakistan,"" focused on precipitation variability in West South Asia, a region that includes Pakistan and parts of India. The South Asian climate is commonly studied due to the area's high population and strong monsoon season, which can bring up to 70% of the annual rainfall in a few months.The region is strongly affected by the pattern of sea temperature changes in the Pacific Ocean known as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. However, the areas of Pakistan most recently impacted by extreme monsoons typically receive very little rain during the summer, as rain-producing low-pressure systems dissipate by the time they reach the region. The severity of monsoon flooding in Pakistan in 2010 and 2022 suggests that extraordinary atmospheric conditions beyond ENSO have influenced recent weather patterns.""We know that floods and droughts occur naturally in this region,"" said Moetasim Ashfaq, a computational climatologist at ORNL and lead author of the study. ""Our motivation was to understand what is causing the change in their intensity. Is it natural variability or climate change or both?""Visualization of specific humidity (0.0123 KgKg-1) in the atmosphere colored by zonal winds. The strongest colors represent magnitudes greater than ± 10 m/sec. Warm (cold) colors represent eastward (westward) flow. The animation runs from July 1  to Aug. 31, 2022. The convergence zone of the winds represents the position of the monsoon trough. Credit: Moetasim AshfaqTo explore this question, the research team analyzed detrended monthly monsoon precipitation data from West South Asia as well as global land and ocean surface temperatures. Detrending removes large data trends, such as those driven by increasing global temperatures, that may obscure additional factors contributing to changing cyclical patterns.The team's analysis identified a combination of oceanic and atmospheric factors that impact the precipitation in Pakistan—including ENSO andsea surface temperaturesin the western Pacific and northern Arabian Sea—and internal atmospheric variability related to jet stream meandering, which is largely responsible for weather systems moving farther west over Pakistan.The analysis showed that the influence of these climate factors has increased during the 21st century, which Ashfaq suggests is due to their increased strength, simultaneous occurrence (called co-occurrence) or a combination of both.The co-occurrence of forcings has a particularly strong influence on precipitation variability, Ashfaq said. For example, when a moderate ENSO occurs with other forcings, such as jet stream meandering, it can impact precipitation in West South Asia more significantly than when it occurs alone. This phenomenon could explain why ENSO was more influential during the 2010 and 2022 flooding events.Althoughnatural climate variabilitycan explain more than 70% of the precipitation variability over Pakistan, Ashfaq explained that climate change may still play an indirect role. The increased variabilities in jet stream and sea surface temperatures and co-occurrence of multiple forcings may be caused by climate change. Additionally, more atmospheric moisture caused by warmerglobal temperaturescan lead to heavier rainfall, especially when combined with other dynamic forcings. However, further research is necessary to fully understand theimpact of climate changeon monsoons in Pakistan.""The link between climate change and extreme weather should be carefully evaluated,"" Ashfaq said. ""Climate change may have an indirect role in shaping the changes in the characteristics of identified forcings, but they're all part of naturally occurring variability in the atmosphere and the oceans.""Some of the identified mechanisms related to the internal atmospheric variability that influences monsoon extremes over Pakistan are less predictable, so forecasts of such events may be limited, Ashfaq said. For example, seasonal forecasting systems predicted above-normal monsoon rains over West South Asia for 2022, but the actual rainfall significantly exceeded the predicted amounts. Nevertheless, the insights into the natural climate drivers that impact summer precipitation at the western margins of the South Asian monsoon region could help future investigations of surrounding regions and the development of better predictive models."

Islamabad, Pakistan– Syed Muhammed is holding a prescription a doctor wrote for his ailing mother, whom he carried on his shoulders to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. But there are no shops to buy medicines. “What use do I have for this paper? There is no market here. I don’t have any money. Where do I get the medicine for my mother now?” he asked Al Jazeera. Muhammad is among nearly 1.7 millionundocumented Afghan refugeesand migrants ordered by the Pakistani government to leave the country by Wednesday. “Holding centres” have been set up in all of the country’s four provinces to detain “illegal” foreign nationals who do not leave by the deadline. Most of the refugees and migrants have converged at the Torkham border crossing in northwestern Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, awaiting exit formalities being conducted by officials belonging to Pakistan’s National Database Registration Authority. The paperwork has resulted in a huge queue. There are no shelters, so families have been forced to sleep on top of trucks and on the open ground.Chaotic sceneshave been witnessed at the transit point amid fears of a government crackdown starting Thursday against those who remain in Pakistan. Officials said more than four million foreigners live in Pakistan, a vast majority of them Afghan nationals who have sought refuge over the past four decades. The exodus began with the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and continued during the post-9/11 US invasion and the second takeover of the government in Kabul by the Taliban in 2021.      Refugees such as Azeemullah Mohmand said their lives had beencompletely uprootedand they have no idea how to restart them in Afghanistan, where decades of conflict have disrupted its economy and created a humanitarian crisis. “I lived in Pakistan for more than a decade. I have three children and a large, extended family, who are being pushed back after the government did not fulfill its promise of providing us proper documentation. I have no money, no roof. Where do I go back to?” Mohmand told Al Jazeera. The eviction drive and lack of facilities at the border crossing have angered the returning Afghans, who chanted slogans against the Pakistani government. “They are already kicking us out, so why do they even have to make us wait in queues and humiliate us even more? Just let us go now,” Noor Agha told Al Jazeera. Agha, 25, who spent more than five years in Pakistan, reached the deportation centre on Tuesday night along with his family of eight. Sardarullah, a 38-year-old Afghan labourer who worked for more than four years in Pakistan’s most populous Punjab province, also complained about the lack of privacy for women and children. “We are sitting here out in the open with no shelter, no place to go for a washroom, no place to sit properly. First, they want to throw us out of the country, and then they don’t even fulfill promises of giving us a dignified exit,” he told Al Jazeera. Fazal Rabbi, an official overseeing the deportation process in Landi Kotal, a city 6km (3.6 miles) from the Torkham border crossing, said he expected thousands of people to complete their identification process on Wednesday. “It is the first day after the  expiry of the deadline, so naturally, there is a lot of rush, and things are moving a little slowly,” he told Al Jazeera. Rabbi said the government is trying to provide better facilities at the crossing. “We have set up portable toilets here while installing more in light of a heavier influx of people in the coming days. Provincial authorities have also provided us with tents to provide shelter for the people in case it rains or gets cold,” he said. But rights group have slammed Pakistan’s decision to deport Afghan refugees and demanded Islamabad reverse its decision. “Pakistan must meet its international legal obligations, including the principle of non-refoulement and stop the crackdown against and harassment of Afghan refugees across the country,” Amnesty International said on Tuesday night. “More than 1.4 million refugees are at risk of being uprooted from the place they have taken refuge and called home. There is still time for Pakistan to act swiftly today to avoid creating a crisis where families are rendered homeless, denied access to livelihood and basic services, and separated in the lead-up to the harsh winter months.” Human Rights Watch said the Pakistani government is “using threats, abuse and detention to coerce” Afghan asylum seekers without legal status to return to Afghanistan. “The situation in Afghanistan remains dangerous for many who fled, and deportation will expose them to significant security risks, including threats to their lives and wellbeing,” it said.

Cricket fans in Pakistan have been left ruing their fate after being unable to travel to India for the ongoingICC Cricket World Cupdue to a lack of clarity on acquiring Indian visas. Several match ticket holders told Al Jazeera that their money spent on the tickets will go to waste as the Indian High Commission in Pakistan has still not announced a visa policy for match ticket holders from Pakistan – even though the tournament began on October 5 and India will play Pakistan this Saturday in the biggest match in cricket. “We are not eligible for a refund as we fall under the ‘no show’ category,” Umer Faizan, a cricket fan who had tickets to Pakistan’s first two matches of the tournament, told Al Jazeera from Pakistan’s capital Islamabad. “The tournament has been under way for nearly a week but there is still no visa policy for Pakistani fans,” he said. Given the bitter ties between the two countries, the visa-seeking process is long and tedious and often requires background security checks from government security agencies on both sides, which can cause long delays. Pakistanis planning to travel to India for special events, such as the World Cup, are asked to apply under special visa policies that are created to cater to match ticket holders and journalists covering such events. Faizan bought theticketsin a pre-sale offer in August, nearly two months ahead of his team’s first match on October 6. “I bought the tickets with three other friends and it was going to be a trip of a lifetime for us to go watch our team in India, but we have no information on how to get an Indian visa.” The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) says it has raised “serious concerns and alarm” over the dilemma faced by fans and journalists and conveyed the message to the Indian government via a long-winded diplomatic route. “PCB Chairman Zaka Ashraf has asked Pakistan’s Foreign Secretary Syrus Sajjad Qazi to take up the issue with India’s Home Ministry through Pakistan High Commission Office in New Delhi,” the board said in a statement this week. Pakistan and India have downgraded diplomatic relations following the tensions emanating from the 2019 attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir and India’s retaliatory cross-borderair attackson what it called “terrorist training camps”. On Wednesday, the PCB said Pakistani journalists had been asked to submit their passports to obtain visas after Ashraf’s “conversation with the foreign office helped in achieving a positive development”. Earlier, Pakistani journalists were asked by the ICC to “submit” their questions for Pakistan’s post-match press conferences via WhatsApp messages to PCB’s media team who will read them out to the cricket team’s representatives. So magnanimous of the organisers to allow Pakistani journalists to send questions for Pak press conference in by WhatsApp ahead of Pakistan’s 2nd gamepic.twitter.com/ruamIyRlD6 — Osman Samiuddin (@OsmanSamiuddin)October 8, 2023  In 2011, India co-hosted the tournament with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and several Pakistani fans and journalists were able to travel across the border for their team’s semifinal against their neighbouring country. Sana Kazmi, a well-travelled die-hard Pakistan fan, watched the semifinal in Mohali in 2011 but has cancelled her plans to cross the border this time. “In 2011, the Indian visa website was a complete nightmare to navigate but at least we got through in the end,” she said. “This time, we aren’t able to access the website at all.” Kazmi and her two friends crossed into India from the Wagah-Attari border hours ahead of the 2011 India-Pakistan semifinal. When they needed help finding tickets and booking a hotel room, complete strangers from across the border saw Kazmi’s pleas for help on social media and stepped in to ensure Pakistani fans got help. “If Pakistani fans or journalists post anything on social media about the difficulties they are facing in travelling to India for this World Cup, they receive crude and insulting responses from Indians,” Kazmi said. A Pakistani fan who has tickets to the tournament’s marquee clash at Ahmedabad on Saturday said he has all but given up on being able to watch it at the world’s biggest cricket stadium. “I spent thousands of [Pakistani] rupees to get my hands on ticket, but it will all go to waste as I have no hopes of getting a visa in time,” he told Al Jazeera, requesting anonymity. “I have tried reaching out to government officials in Islamabad but they are as clueless about the visa process as us.” Pakistani media and fans are not allowed to visit India for#WorldCup2023– this is just appointment, no visa policy announced by Indian authorities for the World Cup, we have to rely on Indian media for the stories of Pakistani cricket team and then there are empty stadiums. — Shiraz Hassan (@ShirazHassan)October 6, 2023           Follow Al Jazeera English:"

If Pakistan lost by 6 wickets or 100 runs, they would give 30 per cent off on the use of code “EkShaheenHaar”. If Pakistan lost by 3 wickets or 50 runs, then the company would give 10 per cent discount on the use of code “NoMaukaMauka”.

Not many might remember but his sizzling hundred against India in the 2017 Champions Trophy final was the final straw that broke the camel’s back as far R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja go; both leaked 147 in 18 overs and went wicketless as Zaman put them out of white-ball cricket for a long while. But that was then. He is now part of Pakistan’s problem in the first Powerplay. “We’re not getting what we would like to get out of our Powerplay,” Pakistan’s coach Grant Bradburn said ahead of their second game against Sri Lanka. When specifically asked about Fakhar’s spot, Bradburn would say, “We’ve got four to five options that we could put out at the top of the order and we’d be very confident that they can deliver not only the runs but the tempo that we want to play at. We want to create a tempo for the middle order and the back end of our innings to build from. We’re not getting that at the moment, so those are discussions that we’re having.”  A post shared by ICC (@icc) From a maverick dasher to a self-doubting plodder, Fakhar’s form has plagued him. Once, in a game against England in that 2017 Champions Trophy, he kept trying hook nearly every ball at Cardiff that had long square-boundaries and shorter straighter ones. In the dressing room, a perplexed captain Sarfraz Ahmed was tearing his hair apart, shouting, “Arre kya kar raha hai yeh! Mat maar, don’t hit”. When Fakhar returned to the dressing room after a breezy 57, he told them his rationale, and would later recount it on Geo Tv: “Bhai, I was trying to arrange for the top-edge! If it connects it would be a six over midwicket, else top-edge six over short boundary!” The team was in splits. How would you plan for a top-edge?! From a man who planned for a top-edge to man surviving edges, now; can he free himself and have a go if he gets one more opportunity? Coming into the tournament opener the 33-year old Fakhar Zaman’s form has been a concern for the side. He had a poor Asia Cup and even in the warmup game against Australia on a belter, the left-hander struggled with his foot movement. Not only haven’t the runs coming, but he has been chewing up deliveries in the Powerplay. The Men in Green has been one of the sides in this World Cup that continues to rely on playing conventional ODI cricket. With three of the top four all being accumulators, it becomes important for Pakistan for someone like Fakhar to start explosively. Even against a mediocre bowling attack like Netherlands Babar Azam’s men managed to post only 286 on the board on a decent batting surface. Once Fakhar fell early, the rest of the batting immediately went into their shells. Their next opponents Sri Lanka has been a bit of a boogie team for Babar’s men in recent times in high-profile games. In the recently concluded Asia Cup Super 4 game in Colombo, Sri Lanka clinched a nailbiter to eliminate them from the tournament. “Yeah, look, we’re really looking forward to playing Sri Lanka. They’re a team that we’ve become familiar with over recent times, obviously with the Asia Cup, and we know well that they have had the upper hand on us over the last year in white-ball cricket,” acknowledged Bradburn. Nevertheless, Bradburn also revealed that Pakistan have a secret weapon up their ranks against Dasun Shanaka’s side for the Tuesday clash.  “We have a secret weapon, if you like, in Mickey Arthur (Team director), who has coached them (Sri Lanka) before,” Bradburn will go on to say. Arthur has been involved with the Sri Lankan team from 2019-2021 and the side almost continues to remain the same. “Our scouting meetings this morning and our video meetings this morning, Mickey was a very, very handy addition to those meetings to be able to add in some intricate points around their batters and bowlers.” Arthur might be the secret weapon but it’s the batsmen who have to provide the secret sauce."

Half-way throughPakistan’s run-chasein the ICC Cricket World Cup match against Sri Lanka on Tuesday, the crowd at Hyderabad’s Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium roared and chanted a famous Pakistani slogan. “Jeetay ga bhaee jeetay ga, Pakistan jeetay ga [Pakistan will win],” they shouted in unison after a prompt from the venue’s DJ. The near-capacity crowd roared for Pakistan’s captain Babar Azam when he stepped on the field and cheered for Mohammad Rizwan when he guided his team home with a fighting century. “The way the crowd showered us with love, we felt like we were [playing] at home,” Rizwan cheerfully told reporters after the match on Tuesday. Pakistan have been based in south India since their arrival in the country nearly two weeks ago, whenlarge crowds gathered at the airportto welcome the team from across the border. “The way people welcomed us at the airport and then chanted for us while we were on the ground – it left us speechless,” the Pakistani wicket-keeper batter said when prompted to comment on the reception accorded to his team. “We have developed a bond of love with the people here.” Videos posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, showed the crowd go up in rapturous applause when Pakistan completed their win. “With the crowd so close to the pitch and cheering so loudly, I felt like I was playing in Pindi,” Rizwan chuckled, referring to the compact cricket stadium in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Loud chants of ""Jeetega bhai jeetega, Pakistan jeetega"" in Hyderabad stadium. They did not start organically but DJ said ""jeetega bhai jeetega"" & left it to the crowd to finish the famous chant.

An elite Kenyan police unit is on trial on a charge of wrongful death following the killing of a Pakistani journalist in Nairobi last year. The case opened at the Kajiado High Court on the outskirts of Nairobi on Tuesday, with petitioners claiming that Arshad Sharif’s death was an “assassination” planned in Pakistan. The critic of Pakistan’s powerful military leadership was killed in October 2022 when the car he was in with another Pakistani man drove through a checkpoint outside the Kenyan capital and police opened fire. At the time, Nairobi police expressed regret over the shooting, saying it was a case of “mistaken identity” during a search for a similar car involved in a child abduction case. But a team of Pakistani investigators later said Sharif’s killing was a “planned assassination”. His widow, Javeria Siddique, filed the case against the Kenyan police unit, known as the General Service Unit or GSU, that was involved in the shooting. Kenyan police claim that Shariff did not stop at a roadblock on the outskirts of Nairobi, but his family and Pakistani investigators disagreed, saying Sharif’s killing was planned in Pakistan. Siddique told The Associated Press: “I am suing the GSU because they committed the crime openly. “For me, it was a targeted assassination because he was living in hiding in Kenya after receiving threats in Pakistan.” Sharif, 50, had fled Pakistan earlier that year to avoid arrest on charges of maligning the country’s national institutions. This term is used for those who criticise Pakistan’s military, who have ruled the country for half of its 75-year history. Along with Siddique, the Kenya Union of Journalists and the Kenya Correspondents have been listed as joint petitioners. The plaintiffs’ submissions to the court accuse Kenyan authorities of “failing to prosecute officers involved in the wrongful death of Arshad” and demand a “public apology to the family of Sharif”. A statement from the union of journalists said, “It has taken us some time to go to court because we thought investigations will be carried out, and the officer who pulled the trigger prosecuted. “Nothing so far has happened, so we are justified to go to court.” In Islamabad, police have charged two Kenyan-based Pakistani businessmen, who had hosted Sharif in the East African country, with involvement in his killing. The case has also drawn international criticism from rights groups.          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Humaira Akhtar Ali, a 20-year-old student, was visiting her friend’s house a few weeks ago in Pakistan’s Swat district in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when she learned about an opportunity of a lifetime: the chance to play in an organised cricket match with other girls on an outdoor public ground. Ali, who is currently in her freshman year in Islamic studies at a local university, has been a passionate cricket fan since she was just five years old. However, she had only ever played the game with her cousins and siblings in her house — never outdoors. When Ali was accepted to play at the organised match, she was thrilled. “I was overjoyed when I got the news. I immediately started practising with my sister and my uncle, who trained me,” Ali tells Al Jazeera by telephone. “There was so much excitement among my family and my friends.” However, when Ali and the other girls arrived at the Charbagh Cricket Stadium in Swat Valley on October 1, they were in for a shock: the match had been stopped by local officials. “We were told that they are not letting us play,” Ali says. “It was so upsetting to us. Were we doing something wrong by playing cricket?” The match had been organised by a local sports coach, Ayaz Naik, who runs a taekwondo academy in the area. The 40-year-old Naik, a passionate sports fan who encourages his own daughters to participate in sports, says that he had been planning to hold a girls’ match in the area for many weeks. Many of the girls who visited his academy were also interested in cricket, he explains, and they had requested his help to train them in the sport or organise a match. “So I thought I will do what I can,” he says. Naik spent almost 100,000 rupees ($355) from his own pocket to purchase cricket equipment. For the match, he says he also worked to earn the trust of the parents of the girls who showed interest in playing cricket, guaranteeing that there would be no promotion for the event or video recordings. Naik kept that promise: He did not go public with his efforts. However, some local social media outlets found out and “spread various kinds of disinformation about our match,” he says. When the teams arrived at the stadium on October 1, government officials had stopped play. Religious leaders also accused Naik of “spreading obscenity and doing something immoral by letting girls play in the open”, the coach adds. “My girls were furious and very upset at the situation. But I told them, this is life, and they will face constant struggles, but the important thing is to stay strong and persevere,” he says with a hint of pride in his voice. The match was cancelled over safety concerns, explains Ihsanullah Kaki, a local councillor. There had been increased incidents of kidnapping, he says, adding “We are definitely not against the girls playing cricket.” “All we asked the organisers,” he says, “was to seek permission from police and other officials.” Naik explains that he debated with the local government officials, who advised that the match should be played on the grounds of a local girls’ school instead of an open field. So he made that happen. On October 3, history was made in Swat: For the first time, a girls’ cricket match took place on the ground of Government Girls Higher Secondary School Kabal. Students watched as a ten-over match was played between two teams. Ali, who played the wicketkeeper, says it was difficult for her to express in words the joy she felt when she stepped on the field for the first time as she donned the keeping pads. “I am a big fan of Pakistani player Muhammad Rizwan who is a wicketkeeper himself, but I never thought I would be doing that, too,” she says. “But for me, the opportunity to play in a ground, it makes me want to emulate my real hero, Sana Mir,” Ali says, referring to Pakistan’s former women’s team captain. “I just hope we have more chances to play often.” Eighteen-year-old Sheema Ghaffar was overjoyed to play in the game she says she loves more than anything else. She has played other sports at school, but cricket is where she wants to excel. Her dream? Becoming a spinner. “I know our society is conservative and traditional. But it was something important for us to be able to play and pursue our dreams, and I am so glad I was able to play in this match,” she tells Al Jazeera. The picturesque Swat Valley, situated some 235 kilometres (146 miles) from the capital of Islamabad, has been a hotbed of violence in the past. It was once briefly under the control of the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group, before the TTP was ousted by a Pakistani military operation in 2009. The valley is also home to global peace activist Malala Yousafzai, who survived an assassination attempt by the TTP in October 2012 on her way home from school. She went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize two years later. Ghaffar, the budding spinner, says that Yousafzai has inspired her. “Malala has been a big role model to me and many other girls, and my parents have seen that. They know that our culture is not very conducive, but they never stopped me,” she says, emphasising that her parents have always encouraged her to participate in sports. Naik acknowledged that while Swat is a traditionally conservative area, women are gradually becoming part of the social fabric. “Our people are starting to understand the need to have women in public. Many are working in banks, and other offices, and allowing such matches to take place will only help normalising their public appearance,” he adds. Although no other matches have been planned at this time, Ghaffar and Ali both say they are eager to play more cricket should the chance arise. “I wish there were more such opportunities to play, as I wish I could play for the Pakistan team and pursue my dream,” Ghaffer says hopefully.

Ahmedabad, India –Cricket fans have poured into Ahmedabad in their thousands, hotel tariffs in the city are up to 20 times the usual, the wealthy have let out their spare homes for about $2,500 a night, and hospitals have observed a most unusual interest in admissions for Saturday, whenIndia host Pakistanin the ICCCricket World Cup. But there will be a glaring absence at thebiggest occasion in cricket: Pakistanis – fans and media – have been all but blocked from attending. The echo in the Narendra Modi Stadium on Saturday will be the incredibly loud sound of one hand clapping. The home team will have more than 100,000 supporters cheering it on, the away side close to none. Scores of Indian journalists are at hand to cover the event, just one from Pakistan. The Indian cricket board has simply ignored its obligations to the International Cricket Council of providing access to media and fans from all teams. “I can’t fathom the situation,” Farrukh Shahzad, a Pakistan cricket fan and Glasgow resident, told Al Jazeera. “This is a world event. It is an ICC event.” Pakistanis living overseas have found that holding passports of their adopted countries does not count for much. If they were born in Pakistan, or their parents or grandparents were, the chances of getting a visa on time are just as slim as resident Pakistanis. Shahzad, a dual citizen, was told at the Indian consulate he would have to apply on his Pakistani rather than his British passport. He failed to secure an online ticket for the India-Pakistan match and saw reports that they were selling on the black market for more than $60,000. Adjusting his expectations, he put in his visa application 11 days ago, with a view to attending the gameagainst Englandnext month. He has no idea whether it will come through. For the T20 World Cup in Australia last year, when India and Pakistan played amatch for the agesin Melbourne, he had got tickets in a ballot nine months in advance. “The next day we booked the flights and hotels, and got the Australian e-visa in five minutes,” he said. Such planning was impossible this time around, with the Indian board’sunprecedented delayin announcing the tournament schedule, which was then changed a mere eight weeks before the first game.      Haider Israr of Brampton, England, has travelled the world with his wife for a decade and a half. “We have special memories of India from 2016 [at the T20 World Cup],” he told me. “We went to Delhi, Jaipur, Ajmer, Shimla, Mumbai. I love India.” He speaks with tenderness about the Pakistan team. “I have pangs in my heart, that I wish I could reach there and support them,” Israr told Al Jazeera. He referred to the Pakistan captain Babar Azam’s words on the eve of the tournament. Azam, although pleased with thewarm receptionhis team received in Hyderabad, said “it would have been better if we had fans from our side”. “My team is missing me,” Israr told me. He is a British rather than a dual citizen but learned that since he was born in Rawalpindi, the process might take a while. He put in an online application last week. “If I get a visa I will come tomorrow. But this time our friends from the Indian community are saying, ‘We cannot help, we’ll get into trouble if we try.’” Ashfaq Hussain, a Dubai-based businessman, like other cricket travellers Al Jazeera spoke to, said he “did not have the courage to even apply” after reading media reports on the visa situation. Jameel Uddin, a Canadian citizen based in Vancouver did not attempt it either; his friend, with whom he had travelled to the 2019 World Cup, was declined a visa. For Shahzad of Glasgow, these events – “a way to make Pakistanis aware that we don’t want to play with you” – have been a dampener. “If I get a visa, I might as well come,” he said. “But it will not be the same thing if there’s just 10-15 of us.” Meanwhile, out of about 70 Pakistani journalists accredited by the ICC, only Shahid Hashmi of AFP made it to Ahmedabad, the afternoon before the game. A handful might arrive in time for the first ball. All of them have missed Pakistan’s first two matches of the tournament. The BBC’s Aatif Nawaz, who had applied for a visa in August, pulled out 10 days ago owing to the delays and uncertainty. “Jarvo got a visa but I didn’t. Not gonna lie. Hard not to take that one personally,” he posted on X last week, referring to Daniel Jarvis – an English prankster and serial pitch invader, who got onto the field during India’s opening game against Australia.  If they had the will, the Indian government and the cricket board would have had little trouble in making arrangements for its visiting neighbours. The secretary and principal decision-maker at theIndian cricket board, Jay Shah, is the Home Minister Amit Shah’s son. The home ministry, via its security agencies, vets Pakistani visa applications. The Indian board has made no comments on the visa situation. A couple of months ago, at a semi-formal meeting with the press, which is how he prefers his media interactions, Jay Shah brushed aside questions on the matter, suggesting it was inappropriate to even raise them. The ICC, much the junior in its relationship with the Indian board, has only uttered bland nothings.  While it is always onerous for Indians and Pakistanis to obtain visas to one another’s countries, provisions are usually made for special events. On the tour of Pakistan by India in 2004 – the largest movement of people between the countries since the early days after partition – names approved by the Indian board were granted Pakistani visas within 24 hours. Thousands of other fans were able to cross the border, on flights, trains and buses. At the 2011 World Cup, Pakistan played just one match in India – a semifinal against the home team in Mohali – for which a small number of Pakistani fans were able to come over at very short notice. The only Pakistani fan presence in this tournament has been “Chicago Chacha” Mohammad Bashir, an elderly American Pakistani whose spouse is Indian. Outside the stadium in Ahmedabad the day before the game he was surrounded by television cameras, while bystanders hollered the Hindu chant “Jai Shri Ram” into his ear, goading him to repeat it. He did not take the bait. The largest presence at the venue in the lead-up has been thousands of khaki-clad police – some 6,000 security personnel are on match duty – lending the gargantuan premises a somewhat sullen air. Elsewhere in Ahmedabad, the joint commissioner of police told the Indian Express that the security forces are keeping an eye on “75 communal pockets”: security-speak, in a segregated city, for areas with mixed-religion populations.  On the streets, nobody seems too concerned by the absence of Pakistanis. Many are reluctant to discuss it at all. “They should definitely have been here, we should all enjoy the match in a sportsman’s spirit,” one resident told me, yet found different ways to hedge this admirable sentiment. “If the government hasn’t given them visas there must be good reason. Anyway, the media just makes up stories. You watch, I am sure lots of Pakistanis will be here.” Such is the intensity of outside interest in the match, the mood in the city seems indifferent by comparison. Some of it, a tea vendor told Al Jazeera, is down to the Ahmedabad ethic: work when you work, play when you play. He, like everyone else, expects deserted roads on match day. Tickets, hard to get hold of, have been released in mysterious tranches – 14,000 of them suddenly made available last week. One person who does have a ticket was a co-passenger on a flight from Delhi. A US resident of Indian background, he was travelling to his home town, and had not planned on watching the match. So how did he get one? “Well, my friend got it,” he said after a moment’s hesitation. “He lives in the same neighbourhood as Mr Shah.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Some of the most thrilling encounters in sport have been between nations or athletes withhistoric rivalriesthat add an extra layer of anticipation and drama. In cricket, these rivalries range from sour relations stemming from decades-old conflicts to colonial history and some newly-formed bitterness. TheICC Cricket World Cupwill see all of these rivalries play out on the field as the tournament’s round-robin-styled group stage means all 10 teams play each other on at least one occasion. Here is a look at some of the most thrilling match-ups in the history of the game: The clash that has been the biggest, quickest-selling and most anticipated match of every multilateral cricket tournament. Therivalryoriginated in 1947 when India waspartitionedinto two countries following British colonial rule. Pakistan and India have since fought three wars, and diplomatic ties between both countries have mostly remained bitter. On the cricket field, the head-to-head record favours Pakistan in Test matches (12-9) and one-day internationals (73-56) while India have the upper hand in T20 matches (8-3). When it comes to World Cup history, the scale is heavily tilted in India’s favour. Pakistan have never beaten India in the ICC ODI World Cup in their seven meetings and have only won once in their seven encounters in the T20 World Cup. This time around, the match is scheduled for October 14 at the world’sbiggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. Ticketsfor the high-profile match sold out within an hour of release and travelling fans have been finding it difficult to find accommodation in and around the city, according to reports in Indian media. Fans in Pakistan, meanwhile, have beenunable to even travel to Indiafor the World Cup due to issues acquiring Indian visas. The oldest rivalry in the game – dating back to the 1800s – originated when a British newspaper famously wrote a condescending and racist article on Australia’s cricket team. It was set in stone when, in 1882, British tabloid The Sporting Times published a mock obituary of English cricket following their Test team’s defeat to their trans-continental rivals, saying“the body [of English cricket] will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia”. The bitterness originated from Test cricket and comes to the fore during theAshes Test series, but has carried on toall sporting encountersbetween both countries. In Cricket World Cup history, both teams have met on nine occasions. Australia have won six of those matches and England three, the most recent and important being their eight-wicket semifinal win at home in 2019 en route to their first World Cup title. England’s first T20 World Cup title also came at Australia’s expense, when they won the 2010 final in the West Indies. The ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 edition of Australia vs England is scheduled for November 4 at Bengaluru. Afghanistan and Pakistan have been involved in acomplicatedgeopolitical and cultural relationship for several decades and share a porous border that is often subject to violence andabrupt closures. The political tensions have translated into a fierce on-field rivalry, especially over the past few years as Afghanistan have swiftly built a reputation as world beaters. Several members of the early Afghan cricket team, including former captains Gulbadin Naib and Mohammed Nabi, picked up the sport while living in Pakistan as refugees during the decades of war and turmoil in their home country. Pakistan’s National Cricket Academy in Lahore hosted the players for training sessions. Some of the earliest coaches of the Afghan team also came from Pakistan. However, the historical tension between the countries has often come to the fore when the teams have met in recent years. Although Pakistan hold a 7-0 lead over their neighbours in ODI cricket and a 4-2 lead in T20 internationals, some recent matches have seen last-ball finishes that have gone Pakistan’s way. Fast bowler Naseem Shah has been a consistent thorn in the Afghan side by twice taking Pakistan home when a loss seemed certain. This mix of history and last-ball finishes has ended up igniting a fire in both sets of fans. Things got particularly ugly last year when some angry Afghan fans vandalised the stadium and threw chairs at their Pakistani counterparts after losing athrilling matchin the 2022 Asia Cup. This came after tempers flared on the pitch when Pakistani batter Asif Ali angrily waved his bat at Afghan bowler Fareed Ahmad. The neighbours meet again in Chennai on October 23. It started with a dance, specifically the “nagin dance”, in 2018. Bangladesh bowler Nazmul Islam had been doing the nagin (cobra in Hindi) dance to celebrate his wickets for some time, so when his side beat Sri Lanka in the T20 series in January 2018, he pulled it out again for all four of his wickets. Sri Lanka’s Danushka Gunathilaka did not take kindly to the serpentine celebration and did his own version to mock Islam when he dismissed two of Bangladesh’s batters. A few months later, the celebration gained traction during the triangular Nidahas trophy, which also included India. When Bangladesh recorded their second win against hosts Sri Lanka, their entire team broke out into an overzealous “nagin dance” celebration on the pitch. 2018 – Nagin Celebration by Bangladesh after knocking out Sri Lanka from Nidahas Trophy. 2022 – Nagin Celebration by Chamika Karunaratne after knocking Bangladesh out of Asia Cup.pic.twitter.com/Po7yhyeAb5 — Mufaddal Vohra (@mufaddal_vohra)September 1, 2022  The night ended with shattered glass in the visiting team’s dressing room and nothing has changed since. Every time both teams meet, there is no shortage of provocative placards in the stands and venomous celebrations on the field. In ODI cricket, Sri Lanka have won 42 of their 53 ODI meetings between both countries, while Bangladesh have won nine. They also hold the upper hand in the World Cup, four wins in five matches. The South Asian nations are set to meet on November 6 in New Delhi. While these two of the sport’s “big three” have been playing against each other since the 1940s, the contest picked up traction in the 1980s and became a full-on rivalry in the 2000s. Most of the heated exchanges and thrilling encounters have taken place in Test cricket’s Border-Gavaskar Trophy, especially since the famous Eden Gardens Test match in 2001 that saw India come back from a follow-on to win the match by two wickets. A heated exchange between Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh and Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds led to the famous “monkeygate” scandal, which saw Singh get banned and then unbanned during the series. In the Cricket World Cup, both teams have met in the knock-out stages of the tournament in recent years. In 2011, India famously beat Australia by five wickets in a closely-contested quarterfinal to win the World Cup at home. Australia returned the favour four years later when they eased to a 95-run win in Sydney and went on to lift their World Cup fifth title. Both teams opened their 2023 campaign against each other in a thrilling tie on Sunday in Chennai, which Indiawon by six wicketsafter a rocky start to their run chase. The overall ODI record of 150 matches still favours Australia, with 83 wins compared with India’s 50. The five-time champions have also won in eight of their 13 meetings in the Cricket World Cup and India have won five. The biggest game of the World Cup so far.

Click here to follow our India vs Pakistan Live Blog Indian Expressargues for the inclusion of Shubman Gill and R Ashwin in India’s XI, while Fakhar Zaman for Pakistan’s playing XI in the highly-anticipated ODI World Cup clash between the great rivals inAhmedabad. India’s dominating wins in the first two games make them the runaway favourite for the tournament. But no team can take afford to take Pakistan lightly. Shubman Gill is all set to make a comeback in the playing XI for the marquee World Cup clash against Pakistan. Shubman has missed the opening two matches due to dengue. 99 percent he is available for tomorrow’s game,” Rohit said during the pre-match media conference. Gill looked in fine touch during an extended session at the Motera on Friday. The manner in which Gill faced the bowlers at the nets, it hardly looked like he was hospitalised last Sunday for dengue, with the blood platelet level dipping to 70,000. He is likely to replace Ishan Kishan at top of the order. Veteran spinner R Ashwin is set to return against Pakistan. Although the Ahmedabad track would be another batting track, but Ashwin with his guile is likely to get a nod over Shardul Thakur. Ashwin continues to be a spin-alchemist, enhancing his game with an assortment of variations. Just run through their list of tricks—arm-ball, wrong’un, carrom ball, reverse carrom, off-break, flipper, left-arm orthodox, and left-arm wrist spent—you wonder whether there has been a better confluence of bowling styles ever in ODI cricket? Abdullah Shafiqe’s century against Sri Lanka has made it sure that for India’s match, the toss-up would be between Imam-ul-Haq and Fakhar Zaman. The duo has been a prolific run scorer for Pakistan at the top in recent times, but Fakhar’s woeful form has cost him his place in the team. But at the same time, his record against India are good; how can one forget the 2017 Champions Trophy final and there are high chances that he might come in and replace his opening partner Imam in the playing XI. Ahmedabad looked pretty flat when New Zealand chased 282 with nine wickets to spare against England. That’s consistent with IPL form. India’s dominance over Pakistan is highlighted by four scores of 300 or more in the last five head-to-heads.

This is the direct impact of the choices you have made for the past 20-30 years in cricket. This is the end result, you are getting,” he added. Shoaib says there are not a single cricketer in the current Pakistan team, who is inspiring enough for kids to pick up the sport. “Tell me one thing is this team has one inspiring cricketer. I have seen the likes of Waqar Younis, Wasim Akram,Imran Khan, Steve Waugh, Allan Border, Viv Richards. Which cricketer in the Pakistan team is inspiring enough for kids to pick up the sport. “Why people still watch our videos. We were inspiring the generation. “I have played for Pakistan, my heart bleeds. I will keep supporting Pakistan. If I would have been with Babar now I would have told him step up as captain. This is the worst, which has happened. Now we are playing four teams and let win them all. “If he is watching my videos, okay the system is messed up .. leave it. Play right people. Bring Fakhar back, give him the license to attack. Bring Zaman, look for other options. Play aggressively. Babar should also bat with the strike rate of 120. Pakistan is batting with the strike rate of 80 and 90. Gurbaz was playing at 122. Pakistan plays 150 dot balls in every match. We are scare.” Shoaib feels Pakistan can still do well in the remaining four matches but will Babar Azam, the captain will step up? “Does Babar has the courage, does he has the stamina? does he has the ability? Can he act like 1992 Imran Khan? Can Shaheen become Wasim Akram? Can Haris Rauf become Aquib Javed, Can Shadab become Mushtaq Ahmed? Can this team do this? I believe in this team but do they? God knows,” he said. Shoaib also showered praise on Afghanistan for showing maturity to win their match against Pakistan. “Many congratulations of Afghanistan. They are like our brothers. We have lost to our brother, which is fine. I am very happy for Zadran, Gurbaz … finally they have shown maturity, which was required. They gave themselves time in the middle. Hats off to their management .. Ajay Jadeja and Jonathan Trott, who taught them well. “For the past fifty years, look at Afghanistan. They don’t have infrastructure, there is no first-class cricket. They have been through worse in the past couple of years and after going through everything, they have proven themselves and defeated Pakistan by eight wickets. They are teaching Pakistan how to play cricket. Well done Afghanistan!”"

In 2014, the global governing body banned England all-rounder Moeen Ali from wearing wristbands saying “Save Gaza” and “Free Palestine”. And in 2019, India’s MS Dhoni was ordered by ICC to remove gloves with a controversial dagger logo – apparently a military symbol – in a World Cup game against Australia. However, there seems little chance that the BCCI will take action over Rizwan’s statement. Reports in the Indian media indicate that the BCCI is treating Saturday’s marquee clash as the main event of the Cricket World Cup and has planned a grand pre-match ceremony after deciding not to have an opening ceremony on the tournament’s opening day. The special treatment reserved for Saturday’s match has not escaped some Indian fans’ criticism. They say the BCCI will not boycott the Pakistani team in the biggest match of the tournament. People here are deluded if they believe that BCCI boycotts bilaterals and plays a WC game, only because it's a WC and they can't avoid it. First, a reserve day only for Ind Pak and now this.

Three men who came on a motorcycle fired indiscriminately at 53-year-old Latif and his brother, Haris Hashim, as they were leaving the Noor Madina mosque in Daska town after pre-dawn prayers, officials in the know of developments said. Latif, who was accompanied by his heavily armed guards, and his brother were killed on the spot in the mosque complex. According to an Associated Press report from Lahore, the gunmen pretended to be worshippers to enter the mosque complex. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but local police chief Hassan Iqbal said it appeared that Latif was intentionally targeted. The police chief did not provide further details, the AP report said. Latif alias Bilal alias Noor Al Din, a designated terrorist under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, was the launching commander of the Jaish-e-Mohammed in Sailkot and had been involved in planning, facilitation and execution of terror attacks in India. The officials said that Latif had entered into Kashmir in 1993 from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as a cadre of the banned Hakar-ul-Ansar terror group. However, he was arrested a year later and sent the Kol Balwal jail inJammu. It is believed that he was brainwashed further byMasood Azhar, who was also lodged in that jail till he was set free in 1989 in exchange for the passengers of IC-814, an Indian Airlines plane that was hijacked by terrorists and taken to Kandahar. After spending 16 years in Indian jail, he was deported through the Attari-Wagah border in 2010 and is believed to have got in touch again with Azhar, who had by that time formed the Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group. “This is the biggest blow to JeM on Pakistan soil,” an official said. Latif, a resident of Aminabad in Punjab’s Gujranwala, was wanted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Seven IAF personnel were killed when four JeM terrorists sneaked into the Pathankot Air Force Station on January 2, 2016. The siege went on for three days."

In his speech at the concluding session of the meeting on Wednesday, Xi promised that two Chinese-backed development banks – the China Development Bank and the Export–Import Bank of China – will each set up 350 billion yuan (USD 47.9 billion) financing windows. An additional 80 billion yuan (USD11 billion) will be invested in Beijing’s Silk Road Fund to support BRI projects. Pakistan is the largest recipient of BRI funding for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). India, which boycotted the BRI Forum meeting, has protested to the project as it is being laid through the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. In his meeting with Kakar, Xi said that China and Pakistan are all-weather strategic cooperative partners and ironclad friends, noting that successive Pakistani governments have actively supported and participated in the Belt and Road cooperation. He said over the past 10 years, the CPEC has achieved fruitful results, effectively promoting Pakistan’s economic and social development, and becoming an important signature project of the Belt and Road cooperation. He added that China will continue to support Pakistan in safeguarding national sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. Xi pointed out that the two countries should build an upgraded version of the CPEC that promotes growth, people’s well-being, innovation, green development, and openness. They should also strengthen cooperation in fields including industrial parks, agriculture, mining, and new energy, and facilitate the early implementation of major connectivity projects for tangible results, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. He also expressed the hope that the Pakistani side will take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and institutions in Pakistan. Kakar said that the eight major steps announced by President Xi to support high-quality Belt and Road cooperation will not only strengthen global connectivity but also promote a more just and reasonable global governance system, providing important opportunities for Pakistan and other countries to achieve better development. He said that Pakistan will always be a reliable and trustworthy friend of China and will never allow any force to undermine the Pakistan-China friendship. Pakistan will also be committed to deepening the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership with China, he added. Pakistan is willing to closely cooperate with China to promote high-quality development of the CPEC. The Pakistani government will spare no effort to ensure the safety and interests of Chinese personnel and institutions in Pakistan, Kakar said."

We would urge the international community to respect our sovereignty and territorial integrity. We have raised our concerns about that visit by the US Ambassador to Pakistan with the US side,” the Ministry of External Affairs’ official spokesperson, Arindam Bagchi, said while responding to questions at the weekly briefing on Thursday. The US Ambassador to Pakistan, Donald Blome, travelled to Gilgit and Hunza valleys in the third week of September; the visit was flagged by Opposition parties in Pakistan. The American Embassy in Islamabad said the purpose of his visit was to “explore opportunities for strengthening the region’s climate resilience”. According to Pakistan newspaper, Dawn, the spokesperson of the US Embassy in Islamabad, Jonathan Lalley, said that Pakistan was among the most vulnerable countries with regard to climate change. After Blome’s six-day visit, Pakistan’s Opposition leaders had said “the mysterious activities” of the US Ambassador in the region had raised questions, adding that the Gilgit Baltistan government was not aware of his visit. After the matter became public, the US Ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, was asked for comments. “It’s not my place to react to the US Ambassador in Pakistan but he’s been before and we obviously had part of our delegation in Jammu and Kashmir during the G20 as well,” Garcetti said. When the MEA spokesperson was asked about Garcetti’s comments, he replied: “We don’t think the two situations are equal”."

Bengaluru, India –In March, before an India vs Australia Test match at Ahmedabad’sNarendra Modi Stadium, named in honour of India’s current prime minister, a stage was set up for a pre-match ceremony marking 75 years of India-Australia cricket. Modi and his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese first took a lap of the stadium, waving to spectators in a golf cart modified to look like a golden chariot. They then made their way to the stage to listen to speeches and watch a performance before the Test could start. As part of the ceremonies, Modi was presented with a picture of himself in the Modi stadium. It was a glimpse of the politics that the India-hosted 2023 International Cricket Council (ICC)World Cupwill likely serve up. Home advantage, a hugely talented squad and the Indian cricket board’s sheer financial clout have made the hosts favourites to win the 46-day tournament, which starts on Thursday. A victory would trigger wild celebrations among fans, especially since – despite India’s cricket ruling body having the deepest pockets in the game and the success of the Indian Premier League (IPL), cricket’s most lucrative and popular T20 franchise league – it has been 12 years since India last won a World Cup. From the naming of stadiums to thechoice of venues, and the demonisation of Pakistan and Muslims more broadly, some observers say that Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is using the tournament as a launch pad for a third term in office. Some even speculate that, if India win, Modi may even call for elections six or so months before the BJP’s term ends in June 2024.  Historian, novelist and cricket fan Mukul Kesavan says this World Cup is “more politicised” than ever. “It is hosted by a country whose government turns every event into a celebration of itself with an eye on imminent elections,” Kesavan told Al Jazeera. “From its point of view, the World Cup is a cricketing G20,” he added, referring to the September gathering of the world’s political leaders in New Delhi, which was promoted as a triumph of Modi’s supposed growing global statesmanship. Writing in The Hindu newspaper last week, columnist and author Suresh Menon said the World Cup would serve “as an extended election campaign”. Referring to star players, he even predicted that it “is likely to be remembered not as Kohli’s or Stokes’ or Bumrah’s World Cup so much as the BJP’s World Cup”.  In cricket-mad India, the sport has always been linked with politics. In the age before social media, the main connection between politicians and Indian cricket was a meeting of every victorious team by the prime minister and/or the president of the day at their official residences. Bad performances led to questions in parliament. If any political dignitary came to a game, they would meet the players either at the start of the game or during a break, with quick handshakes down the line before heading to the viewing gallery. Meanwhile, leading politicians from various parties have headed theBoard of Control for Cricket in India(BCCI). But the BJP has taken the nexus to a new level; most significantly through its widespread control of the BCCI. The BJP’s direct line into the BCCI and the organising of the World Cup is through its secretary Jay Shah, 35, son ofAmit Shah– India’s powerful home minister and Modi’s right-hand man – as well as other officials across all levels, particularly the BCCI’s member state cricket associations. Former India cricketer and World Cup winner Kirti Azad, who was also a BJP member of parliament before leaving the party to join the opposition Trinamool Congress, says, “There is nothing wrong with having a politician [in cricket administration], but the problem is when they start using the game as a tool for their own means.” While the ICC is the official organiser of the World Cup, and the BCCI made no formal announcement of a tournament director, Shah has been the major voice, face and spokesperson of the event. Every BCCI decision around the World Cup –the schedule, the choice of venues, opacity around tickets for public sale – is being viewed, fairly or unfairly, through the lens of politics. The BCCI did not respond to a request for comment. The BCCI’s decision not to hold matches in the city of Mohali, which staged memorable World Cup matches in 1996 and 2011, is seen by some as a snub against the state of Punjab, which voted in one of the BJP’s political rivals to power in thestate electionslast year.      Meanwhile, the most physical expression of the amalgamation of Indian cricket and contemporary politics has come through the construction of the world’s biggest cricket stadium in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad, the capital of PM Modi’s home state of Gujarat. Its construction began in 2015, a year after Modi became prime minister. The stadium can seat as many as132,000 spectators, and its first event was a political rally for Donald Trump in 2020. In 2021, it was named the Narendra Modi Stadium. The majority of Indian sports venues are named after politicians, particularly leaders of the BJP’s rivals the Indian National Congress, but it was the first time that a politician honoured was still in office. At the 2023 World Cup, the Modi stadium will host its opening match and the final as well as three other fixtures including, on October 14, the biggest fixture in cricket: India vs Pakistan. Author and senior cricket writer Pradeep Magazine suggests that, as well as commercial and capacity concerns, the decision to stage the match in the city – made by the BCCI as well as local and national government and security – has a political dimension by getting Pakistan to play in “the capital of the state which is the BJP’s Hindutva laboratory. In which they have successfully used the politics of Hindu-Muslim riots to come to power”. Modi served as the Gujarat chief minister from 2001 to 2014, and has denied allegations by rights groups that he tacitlysupported the 2002 riotsin the state in which dozens of Muslims were killed. Under Modi, Indian Muslims have been increasinglydemonised and discriminated against. “There has never been an Indian government like this BJP government – which is not just anti-Pakistan, but anti-Muslim,” Magazine said.      The Indian government alsodelayed issuing visasfor the Pakistan team, requiring them to scrap plans for a two-day training camp in Dubai. Then their first warm-up game in Hyderabad on September 29 was held behind closed doors. According to the Indian Express, the Hyderabad police were unable to provide security due to the staging of two festivals which “culminate on September 28”. The two festivals, one Hindu and one Muslim, were, in fact, held the day before the match. Meanwhile, under Modi’s rule, India’s mainstream media has increasingly turned cricket and the enormously talented and watchable Indian team into a symbol of a heightened Hindu nationalism and jingoism of the BJP’s “new India”. Television coverage and advertising around every multinational cricket event focuses on India’s domination of their rivals and the ridiculing of the opposition, particularly Pakistan over its World Cup defeats to India. Shortly after Pakistan landed in Hyderabad, TV news media made much of their inability to find beef on their hotel menus – cow worship being one of the BJP’s chief political planks. However, these efforts were belied somewhat by thewarm welcomethe Pakistan team got on their first arrival on Indian soil for seven years late last month.      Meanwhile, outside of social media, there has been very little criticism in the mainstream media of theBCCI’s handling of the World Cup– either of the confusion over scheduling, logistical issues for travelling fans, and the difficulties in buying tickets. Kesavan calls Indian cricket a “paradox,” with the World Cup run-up proof of how “a massively successful commercial operation that can’t transparently sell tickets to cricket’s greatest event”. But any criticism of the BCCI and India’s World Cup is now seen as a criticism of Jay Shah, and by extension, the home minister and the ruling government, and so is seen as best avoided. Modi himself is not involved in any advertisements or marketing for the Cricket World Cup, but his social media feed constantly features cricket, and he is expected to be at the India-Pakistan game. BJP party insiders say that should India perform strongly, invitations will go out to heads of state from other nations to be a part of key matches. Jayaditya Gupta, consultant editor at ESPN India, played down the politicisation of the 2023 World Cup by saying it is not so different to that at other global sporting events he has reported on, such as football World Cups. “Large sports events have long been used to make statements,” he said. “I think it is unexceptional for politicians to associate themselves with social or cultural success, and [try and] distance themselves when things hit the fan.” Yet, with such political stakes loaded onto a tournament, there is always the possibility of pitfalls; particularly if the Indian team stumbles – either against Pakistan or at the final hurdle. “I just wonder if Pakistan win that game in Ahmedabad, what would happen?” Magazine asked. “How would [the BJP] react and how would their own people react? So are they taking a risk by hosting it there?”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

The International Cricket Council (ICC) Men’sCricket World Cuphas witnessed evolving formats, stiff competition, and tense controversies over nearly five decades. The 13th edition of the tournament, being hosted by two-time winners India, will be held from October 5 to November 19 and will see 10 teams vie for the one-day international (ODI) cricket’s most coveted trophy. Here is a look back at the tournament’s 47-year history. The ICC was founded in 1909, with England, Australia, and South Africa as the only members. The three countries played a Test cricket tournament in 1912, but poor weather conditions in England and a lack of public interest meant the competition did not happen again. Teams around the world continued to play bilaterally until the ODI format gained popularity in the 1960s, following its introduction in English county cricket. The first Cricket World Cup of any kind was a women’s tournament organised in 1973 by the International Women’s Cricket Council, which later merged with the ICC. Hosts:England Winners:West Indies As the only country with enough resources to host the event, England eventually organised the first Men’s Cricket World Cup in 1975 with eight teams in the competition and the ODI format in its fifth year. The six Test-playing nations at the time – Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and the West Indies – were joined by Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa. South Africa, one of the strongest teams in world cricket, were serving a ban from international cricket over the country’s apartheid-era policies. The tournament was played in white kits, with red balls and in a 60-overs-a-side format. The West Indies defeated Australia by 17 runs to win the trophy in the final at Lord’s. Amid the celebrations, which saw fans pour down to the field, a pitch invader stole famous British umpire Dickie Bird’s hat. Hosts:England Winners:West Indies Based on the success of the inaugural competition, the World Cup became a recurring event on the international cricket calendar and was mooted to be held every four years. The competition stayed in England, who made it to the final but lost to the defending champions West Indies by 92 runs. England’s leading bowler Bob Willis missed the final match due to an injury that he suffered in the semifinal. Star West Indies batter Viv Richards was awarded man of the match for his 138 runs from 157 balls. Hosts:England Winners:India Breaking the West Indies’ shot at treble, India’s 1983 World Cup win made them a force to be reckoned with and their captain Kapil Dev a household name in his country. In what is considered an iconic moment in the tournament’s history, Kapil Dev ran backwards to complete a catch that saw Richards dismissed for 33 as India completed a 43-run win. In a famous statement, David Frith, then-editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly, said: “Show me a person who gave Kapil Dev’s team any chance of winning the 1983 World Cup and I will show you a liar and an opportunist.” The Indian team’s 1983 World Cup win became a famous underdogs story and was depicted in the 2021 Bollywood film titled 83. Hosts:India and Pakistan Winners:Australia For the first time, the tournament was held outside England as it switched to a 50-over format to adjust to fewer daylight hours in the Indian subcontinent. After having three tournaments with all-English umpires, this World Cup was the first to feature neutral umpires. Australia and England faced off in one of the closest World Cup finals at the famous Eden Gardens stadium in Kolkata, then known as Calcutta, after defeating co-hosts Pakistan and India in their respective semifinals. Australia beat England by seven runs and David Boon was named player of the match for his 75 runs. Pretournament favourites West Indies did not advance past the group stage. Hosts:Australia and New Zealand Winners:Pakistan As the tournament returned after five years and moved Down Under for the first time, it brought several changes: coloured kits, white balls and day-night matches played under floodlights. It was also the first World Cup to include television replays and the use of a third umpire to adjudicate run-out appeals. With the end of apartheid, South Africa returned to international cricket and were included in the tournament for the first time, increasing the number of teams to nine. They advanced to a memorable semifinal, where a controversial “rain rule” left them needing 22 runs off one ball when play resumed after a rain delay. In a defining moment for Pakistani cricket, Imran Khan led his team of self-styled “cornered tigers” to a 22-run victory over England. Hosts:India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka Winners:Sri Lanka Sri Lanka joined second-time organisers India and Pakistan as co-hosts in the midst of a civil war in the island nation. The tournament was hit by a controversy before it began, as several countries refused to play in Sri Lanka. Australia and West Indies forfeited their matches in Colombo after a bombing at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in the capital three weeks before the tournament. The ICC then awarded two points to Sri Lanka, who became the first team to qualify for the quarterfinals. Controversies continued to plague the tournament. An unruly crowd in Kolkota disrupted India’s semifinal against Sri Lanka when the hosts lost their eighth wicket. Meanwhile, Pakistani cricketer Wasim Akram’s house in Lahore was stoned by an angry mob after he pulled out of Pakistan’s quarterfinal against India citing an injury. In the final at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium, Sri Lanka’s Aravinda De Silva and captain Arjuna Ranatunga guided the team home in a chase of 242 against Australia and brought their first World Cup title. Hosts:England Winners:Australia The World Cup returned to England after a 16-year hiatus and was held a year early to avoid a clash with the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. The number of teams increased to 12, with Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Kenya, and Scotland joining the lineup. Pretournament favourites Australia and Pakistan met in the final, which turned out to be a one-sided match after Pakistan were bowled out for 132 runs, setting off Australia’s treble run in the tournament. Hosts:South Africa Winners:Australia The first World Cup to be held on the African continent saw star Indian batter Sachin Tendulkar shine with 673 runs, and Australia play without legendary spinner Shane Warne as he served a ban after testing positive for a prohibited drug. Australia beat India by 125 runs in the final in Johannesburg. Hosts:West Indies Winners:Australia It was a World Cup beset by controversy, tragedy and upsets. Pakistan’s South African coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room a day after his side’s shocking three-wicket loss to Ireland in the group stage. Following Woolmer’s death, organisers imposed restrictions on music and celebrations in the stands. Bangladesh shocked India by beating them by five wickets in the group stage. India and Pakistan failed to progress to the Super Eight stage. Australia continued their golden run in the tournament and bagged their fourth title after beating Sri Lanka by 53 runs. Hosts:India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka Winners:India India became the first team to win the World Cup on home soil after beating Sri Lanka in the final by six wickets in the first all-Asian final. Australia’s 12-year reign came to an end with a quarterfinal loss to India, who went on to beat Pakistan in an enthralling semifinal in Mohali. Pakistan lost hosting rights for the tournament due to security concerns after the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked by armed men in Lahore on a 2009 tour. Hosts:Australia and New Zealand Winners:Australia The two host nations faced off at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with Australia eventually emerging as the victors in a one-sided final. New Zealand’s Martin Guptill set a new world record for most runs in an ODI innings scoring 237 runs in the quarterfinal against the West Indies. Hosts:England and Wales Winners:England In one of the greatest ODI matches in the game’s history, the last World Cup ended with a tied final match between England and New Zealand at Lord’s Cricket Ground. The match went into a super over but that too ended in a tie and England were awarded the win based on the boundary countback rule. In other milestones, Australia’s fast bowler Michael Starc claimed the most wickets in a competition with 27 dismissals. The number of competing teams fell to 10.          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Indian media reported Tuesday that VK Saxena, the lieutenant governor of Delhi, said there is sufficient evidence to charge Roy and Sheikh Showkat Hussain, a Kashmiri law professor, as part of a 2010 complaint that accused them and two others of sedition. Roy has long been a critic of India’s Prime Minister Narandra Modi and some experts say the case is an effort to silence her. Roy—who became India’s first citizen to win the prestigious Booker Prize in 1997 for her novelThe God of Small Things—and Hussain have been charged by Indian authorities with offenses related to provocative speech and the promotion of enmity between groups. According to the New York Times, Hussain said he wasnot formally made awareof the charges, while Roy told the publication she would speak to her lawyer before discussing the case. Two other co-defendants Syed Ali Shah Geelani, a Kashmiri separatist leader, and Syed Abdul Rahman Geelani, a professor, have died since the original complaint. The original complaint was brought by a right-wing Kashmiri Hindu activist against speakers at a conference titled “Freedom — the Only Way.” The activist claimed that Roy’s speech, and a number of others, “jeopardized public peace and security” by advocating for the separation of Kashmir from India. Kashmir, an Indian-administered territory home to a Muslim majority, is a hugely controversial topic as India and Pakistan both claim its land in its entirety. The two nations have fought two wars and continue to engage in countless skirmishes over control of the territory. During her speech, Roy recalled an incident where she was pressured by a television reporter to answer the question, “Is Kashmir an integral part of India?” According tovideo footageof the event, she told the audience: “So, I said, look, ‘Kashmir has never been an integral part of India. However aggressively and however often you want to ask me that, even the Indian government has accepted that it is not an integral part of India.’” In the immediate aftermath of Roy’s comments, her Dehli home was swarmed with protesters. Tensions surrounding Kashmir were particularly high at the time, following the death of a teenage boy who was hit with a tear-gas canister by Indian forces. The death caused outrage in Kashmir and ignited a year of protest action that saw 120 demonstrators die. A number of high profile literary andlegal figureshave since expressed concern over Roy’s charges, calling out Modi for the decision. “Message to @narendramodi: Hands Off#ArundhatiRoy! You have no idea what you will unleash is [sic] you pursue this political prosecution aimed at silencing your most eloquent critic. She is a hero to millions and we see you,” writer Naomi Klein posted on X on Tuesday. Indian poet Meena Kandasamy, who alsocriticized Modi and the decisionon X, tells TIME, “For a case like that to be revived a dozen years after it was clamped against [Roy] shows the extent of their desperation.” She adds, “It is not only a punishment to Roy, but a deterrent deployed against India's radical writers. It is the regime's way of saying-—we have contained her—do you dare to speak?” If convicted of sedition under India’s draconian sedition law, Roy could face punishment ranging from a fine to life imprisonment. The case comes amid a government crackdown on freedom of expression under Modi. Since 2014, the South Asian nation has dropped from 150 to 161 in this year’smedia freedom rankingsby Reporters Without Borders, which orders 180 countries in total. Meanwhile, the homes and offices of journalists linked toonline publication NewsClick, a prominent critic of the government, were raided in early October. On Tuesday, NewsClick’s founder Prabir Purkayastha, and another person associated with the site were denied bail after facing charges under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, a stringent antiterrorism law. Similarly, BBC offices in India wereraided by tax officialsin February in the wake of a documentary that outlined Modi’s involvement in Gujarat’s 2002 religious riots that left over 1,000 people dead. “What Modi's regime has managed has been to make the entire media landscape into a lapdog media, a pitiable pliant media. The few journalists who did not cower were forced to leave their jobs,” says Kandasamy. She adds that the space for critics to safely critique the government is depleting. “What is brilliant about Roy is that she never needed this traditional media, this crony-capitalist, pro-regime corporate media in order to be heard. They cannot stage-manage her, they cannot contain the PR damage that her criticism will inflict,” Kandasamy says."

Eight million were permanently displaced, and at least 1,700 people died. Damages to crops, infrastructure, industry, and livelihoods were estimated at $30 billion.In response to this, Stanford researchers from the Natural Capital Project (NatCap) and the Carnegie Institution for Science collaborated on a new way to quickly calculate the approximate depths of flooding in different areas and number of people affected.Their analysisoffers insights into potential options and costs for incorporating adaptation to future floods into rebuilding efforts, and shows that climate adaptation measures like these could have helped most, if not all, of the people affected by the flood.""With events of this scale, it's very poorly understood what the costs of climate adaptation would be,"" said Rafael Schmitt, lead author of the paper, published Oct. 25 inEnvironmental Research Letters, and a lead scientist with NatCap. He noted thatclimate adaptationhas been a second priority behind climate mitigation—a trend now called the adaptation gap. But clearly, climate change is here now.""We were motivated by these big floods that are happening now every year, to ask: How can we conduct a very high-level assessment of what it would cost to adapt livelihoods to a changing climate? This could help countries and international donors evaluate the cost-effectiveness of specific adaptation measures,"" Schmitt added, noting the default is often to build back to the status quo, resulting in lack of preparedness for future floods, much as rebuilding from Pakistan floods in 2010 did.A new climate adaptation decision-support toolThe researchers addressed two main options for adapting to future flooding in Pakistan, both of which have been widely implemented across Asia: ""moving up"" by building elevated structures, or ""moving over"" by temporarily relocating when floods occur. The depth of flooding—and how far away dry land is—areimportant factorsfor determining which response makes sense.Locations with shallow flood depths that are far from dry land would favor elevating buildings, while flood depths of greater than two meters make elevated structures impractical and too costly, based on experiences in nearby Bangladesh. Yet flood stage information (i.e., flood depth or severity) to help make this determination has been hard to come by.The team brought togethersatellite dataon where flooding occurred, which are readily available in nearlyreal-time; ground elevation data combined with simplified hydrologic principles (e.g., water flows downhill) to reveal depth; anddemographic dataon population density, housing, and other infrastructure. This produced their ""Floodplain Adaptation Strategies Testbed"" or ""FAST,"" a rapid overview of flood severity and exposure that shows how deep the flooding was in different locations, and how many people were exposed to those depths.Through FAST, the researchers estimated that 26.6 million people in Pakistan were exposed to low water levels (less than 1 meter), 7.4 million people were exposed to water levels between 1 and 2 meters, and 5.7 million people were exposed to more than 2 meters of flooding. Based on this and proximity to dry land, there were 27.5 million people in the ""move up or over"" category (in other words, either strategy could work), 5.1 million people in the ""move over"" category, 6.3 million people in the ""move up"" category, and half a million people in the retreat category (where the flood depths were greater than 2 meters and they're far from dry land).Focusing on the 7.4 million people who experienced 1-2 meters offlooddepth, the analysis estimated adaptation costs between $1.5–$3.6 billion, in addition to the $5.8 billion to rebuild housing to the status quo.Prioritizing equity and resilience in rebuilding effortsThis version of FAST looked only at housing but it could also be applied to other types of infrastructure, such as roads, schools, and hospitals. And in the future, its analyses could become even more detailed because of a new, more advanced NASA Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite, or SWOT.The researchers also recognize that there are other adaptation options besides ""moving up or moving over."" For example, local water agencies often rely on dikes, levees, and other ""hard"" infrastructure—which the researchers warn can promote development in areas prone to flooding, increasing the risk of catastrophic damages if infrastructure fails. Whatever the mix of responses is, FAST could help provide information, but it must be checked to see whether and how these options meet actual community needs.Without analyses like FAST, reconstruction funding can often be directed to those with the greatest influence, who perhaps need the least support.""The study speaks to the potential to incorporate science-informed adaptation measures into reconstruction and disaster response, helping in investment prioritization. This is particularly useful nowadays with the discussions on mechanisms to compensate countries of the Global South for climate-change-attributed damages,"" said Edgar Virgüez, postdoctoral research scientist and deputy group leader at the Carnegie Department of Global Ecology at Stanford and a co-author of the study. The FAST tool could offer a more data-driven and equitable approach to prioritization.""Countries of the Global South, like my native Colombia, would benefit from process-based model assessments at scale and in a timely manner that can guide the investments of scarce resources. Especially since many of these countries lack timely-generated data, which complicates strategic decision investments,"" said Virgüez.An important outcome of the United Nations Climate Conference last year (COP27) was a new Loss and Damage Fund to provide financial support for countries that are most vulnerable to climate change. In this paper, the team urged funders and governments to rebuild with adaptation in mind. To do that, they say, more science should also be directed toward understanding low-cost adaptation options.""Flood models are data-intensive, and you need specialized knowledge to run them,"" said Schmitt. ""We need adaptation research that is easier to use and act on. FAST is a step toward that goal."""
The Indian Express,Sandip G,World Cup: Centurions Mohammad Rizwan & Abdullah Shafique star in record chase for Pakistan,"After hundreds from Mendis and Samarawickrama power Sri Lanka to 344, Rizwan and Shafique's 131 n.o & 113 sets up WC-record chase for Pakistan.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket-world-cup/world-cup-centurions-mohammad-rizwan-abdullah-shafique-star-in-record-chase-for-pakistan-8977113/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/PAK-SL.jpg,2023-10-10 18:33:05.000000,"The images the match produced would blend into World Cup folklore.

Mohammad Rizwan limping and stumbling, compiling a hundred of infinite courage, running the winning run maniacally, before ecstatic teammates swarmed in. The distraught Kusal Mendis gazing pensively into the skies, his disconsolate colleagues walking half-dead. The tale that unfolded this sweaty night in Hyderabad, where Pakistan chased 345 in the most heroic fashion, would be retold a hundred times and reshape into bedtime stories that would fill the imagination of generations. The thriller — at last one, almost a week in — could lift the detachment towards the World Cup. Pakistan’s six-wicket win, hauling down Sri Lanka’s 345, could finally awaken the forgotten joys of ODI cricket. It was ODI cricket as it is meant to be—bending the thrill of T20s and the flowing drama of a Test match. The fight of Rizwan would live long in memory. Towards the end, he seemed to move relatively freely. Perhaps, it was the kick of the knock, the sight of victory twinkling. A few overs ago, though, Rizwan could barely move. After he struck Dhananjaya de Silva for a six, he slumped into the ground, throwing his kit around in a fit of pain. The team of physios would scamper to relieve the pain. As they stretched his legs, he winced in pain. Yet, he staggered back to the ground, biting pain, beating pain, seeing but just the path to victory. He is no stranger to playing with pain; a lung infection and doctor’s advice did not come in the way of him playing in the 2021 T20 World Cup final. It was, in the end, a triumph of self-belief rather than a magic of painkillers, of bravado and will than any skill of technique. He did not even have the energy to celebrate his hundred. He just threw his bat away, knelt on the ground and offered a silent prayer into the flood-lit skies. The pain could have only aggravated, but he did not miss a single opportunity to steal a single or two. And he completed the most memorable win for his country in recent times.   A post shared by ICC (@icc) In any other script, Abdullah Shafique would have been the chief protagonist. His hundred was a treatise in stress-free batting under extreme pressure. His introduction would not have been better-scripted. Pakistan chose the ripest time to blood him in, patchy as the form Fakhar Zaman had been off late. Irresistible as the temptation would have been to give him another go, they packed Shafique in. His previous five innings read: 2, 7, 19, 52. His strike was a measly 72. Stereotyped as a Test specialist — though his first note to fame was for a 55-ball hundred in the National Cup three years ago — a few eyebrows would have been raised. But just as he serenely transitioned from first-class cricket to Tests, commanding an average of 50.83 in 26 innings, the opener asserted that he has the flexibility to adapt his game to the ODIs, and specifically to the demands of a wild chase. There, though, was nothing wild about his knock. Rather it was an exhibition of cultured technique and an unflappable mind. Him completing his hundred was that precise moment, when the eventuality of Pakistan pulling off the chase became a throbbing possibility. Pulling a short ball emphatically to the fence, Shafique crouched down, curled his forearms, let out a shriek that could be heard as far as the deserted Survey of India quarters in the neighborhood, and then exploded into the air. At the end, Rizwan teed off into his own round of celebrations, as Shafique soaked in the sheer joy of completing his maiden hundred in this format. Shafique’s effect was like slow but deadly poison, seeping insidiously into the system. It owed to his utterly risk-free batting, honed by his father Shafiq Ahmed, a former first-class player from Pakistan, coaching in the Emirates, and his uncle Arshad Ali, who has represented the UAE in four games. The required run-rate was nudging into the eight-plus region, but Shafique breathed hope, even assurance. Things began to go awry for Sri Lanka. Dilshan Madushanka’s wayward projectiles were being hoisted to the fence. He leaked 15 more in that over, and Sri Lanka began to wither. Thereupon, Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka sent an SOS to Matheesha Parthirana. He evicted Shafique straightaway, thanks to the agility of the substitute fielder Dushan Hemantha. But there were no more wicked twists and turns as Rizwan steered them to a victory that could transform Pakistan into a ruthless winning machine. Contrastingly, it could devastate Sri Lanka.   A post shared by ICC (@icc) The most striking aspect of their stand was that they seldom panicked, except for the occasional harum-scarum running between the wickets . No stroke birthed from desperation, none from frustration either. They batted as though they were chasing a sub-300 score, watchful and measured, yet ticking the run-rate along. Even the risks they undertook in the initial phase were not wanton gambles. Exceptional were their single-stealing methods, subcontinental in essence, dropping the wrists to the leg-side and strolling for singles, stepping down to spinners and playing them down the ground, usually over the mid-off’s head. Both were decisive with their ideas as well as execution. In the past Rizwan has exemplified that he has the heart and skill to orchestrate a chase. But seldom has it manifested so tellingly. He would meander along in a sense of ennui, before suddenly exploding in bursts. There was no haste about him, but a laidback assurance. He broke the 20-ball boundary drought with an elegant straight drive off Pathirana. In this phase, he would even forgo boundary balls, so that Pakistan have the assurance of wickets. This, in essence, was their method. The old-fashioned way of preserving wickets and dragging the match as far as possible, before shifting through the gears at the end. In the next phase, though, he left no loose ball unpunished. There, Sri Lanka too lost the game’s drift. Maybe, the ghosts of Kotla were still gnawing in their head. They turned outright defensive, sloppy fielding kicked in, and most decisively ran out of ideas. Shafique and Rizwan sensed the wave of nervousness creeping into Sri Lanka’s fielders and bowlers and asserted themselves, lifting the momentum without their opponents even realising it.  Even towards the end, they kept dropping catches. Saud Shakeel was twice spilled in a Theekshana over. Edges fell in no man’s land; mishits evaded the fielders. Sri Lanka might grouse that they were unfortunate, but the only misfortune was that they stumbled onto Rizwan, a limping, stumbling wall of courage."

It was billed as the most anticipated cricket event of the year, held in the sport’s biggest stadium globally, in a country that is known to worship the game. But when the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 finally got under way in India on Thursday, only a few thousand seats were occupied in a stadium that was revamped for the tournament in order to house at least 120,000 spectators. As England and New Zealandsquared offat Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi Stadium, which was renamed after the Indian prime minister in 2021, cricket fans took to social media to express their shock at the rows of empty saffron-coloured seats glaring back at them. England women’s cricketer Danni Wyatt asked “Where’s the crowd?” in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Jemimah Rodrigues, her Indian counterpart, responded by saying the crowd is waiting for India’s match against Pakistan on Saturday, October 14. Waiting for the India v Pakistan game 😁https://t.co/RBNOR2JDtt — Jemimah Rodrigues (@JemiRodrigues)October 5, 2023  Fans have been critical of the tournament’s scheduling and ticketing process. The first batch of tickets went on sale on August 25, less than six weeks before the opening match, making it difficult for travelling fans to put plans into place. Indian cricket fans, who had been waiting for years to watch the sport’s biggest event in their backyard,told Al Jazeerathey had given up on their dream of supporting their team at home. One well-travelled sports fan, Vipul Yadav, described the management of the ticketing process as “nonsensical”. “Nowhere in the world, do you have to struggle so much for a ticket. All this has happened because the ticket release has been done too late,” he said. How does the most populated country in the world have an empty stadium for the opening game of the World Cup for the country’s most loved sport? Ridiculous.#CWC2023#indiapic.twitter.com/vg35JCA4JQ — Adil Ray OBE (@adilray)October 5, 2023  During the first few innings of the England vs New Zealand match, a few hundred fans from both participating countries could be seen in the stands. Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Jay Shah took it upon himself to fill up at least one more seat when he was shown seated in the stands amidst some cheering and confused-looking fans in the middle of England’s innings. As the match went on, local fans began filling up some seats, but the attendance was nowhere close to being at even half capacity. Former India captain Ravi Shastri pointed out during the match commentary that India’s absence in the opening match could be a big factor behind the apparent indifference from local fans. Indeed, it is the first time in 27 years that the opening match of the tournament has not involved a host nation. Ironically, the last time it happened it was also during a World Cup hosted by India, with the same teams facing each other at the same venue – albeit then known as the Motera Stadium.

Later, Tendulkar attempted to painstakingly explain the local fans’ love for international cricketers and promised they would “make it a special event for all players”. But online, the criticism continued. Manya, a cricket fan and writer from India, said building the world’s biggest stadium is not akin to being the world’s sports administrators. Maybe it wouldn't have been this embarassing if you hadn't started ticket sales at the last minute repulsing fans who wanted to travel from NZ/ENG, hoarding tickets and then giving them away for free as a way to save face at the last minute.

These three entities, based in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), have worked to supply missile- applicable items to Pakistan’s ballistic missile programme,” the State Department said in a statement. China, anall-weather ally of Pakistan, has been the main supplier of arms and defence equipment to Islamabad’s military modernisation programme. The three companies include General Technology Limited, Beijing Luo Luo Technology Development Co Ltd., and Changzhou Utek Composite Company Ltd. They were sanctioned for having engaged or attempted to engage, in activities or transactions that have materially contributed to, or pose a risk of materially contributing to, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery (including missiles capable of delivering such weapons), including any efforts to manufacture, acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer or use such items, by Pakistan. General Technology Limited has worked to supply brazing materials, which are used to join components in ballistic missile rocket engines, and in the production of combustion chambers. Beijing Luo Luo Technology Development Co Ltd. has worked to supply mandrels and other machinery, which can be used in the production of solid propellant rocket motors and can be controlled by the Missile Technology Control Regime. Changzhou Utek Composite Company Ltd. has worked since 2019 to supply D-glass glass fibre, quartz fabric, and high silica cloth, all of which have applications in missile systems. Today’s actions demonstrate that the United States will continue to act against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their means of delivery, and associated procurement activities of concern, wherever they occur, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.

The police said that in the past two months or so, they have made at least 11 arrests of people involved in drug supply or peddling. Seven of the arrested men were suppliers, all hailing from Punjab. The remaining four are middlemen, who used to receive the supplies and pump it further in the Tricity area. On interrogation of the suppliers , the police have learnt that almost all the accused had been sourcing the drugs, especially heroin, from Punjab instead of the earlier preferred destination,Delhi. The reasons for this shift, investigators believe, are many. The primary of them being an increasing influx of heroin into Punjab through the use of drones from across the border from Pakistan. Secondly, the quality of heroin coming from Delhi has deteriorated over a period of time.  According to the police, seven of the arrested suppliers, including individuals like Ranjeet Singh and Harpreet Singh from Amritsar, were found to be directly involved in cross-border drug smuggling through the use of drones in Punjab. These suppliers mostly hail from Amritsar or Tarn Taran districts in Punjab and were apprehended by two seperate investigation agencies, the Crime Branch and District Crime Cell — both of who focus primarily on combating organised crime inChandigarh. The Crime Branch arrested four of the Punjab-based suppliers, while the District Crime Cell had nabbed three. An officer in the Crime Branch said, “The last known case in Chandigarh, where heroin was traced back to Delhi was in June this year, when a Rapido bike driver named Sunil was arrested with 26.58 grams of heroin. He revealed that he had sourced his supply from a Nigerian national in Delhi. Since then, for most of our heroin seizures, we have determined the source to be Punjab-based suppliers. The demand for heroin procured from Punjab appears to be higher compared to supplies from other regions, including Delhi.” An officer of Chandigarh Police said that apart the suppliers who have been arrested, there are instances where investigators had identified the suppliers to be from Punjab but are yet to arrest them. One such example was that of a supplier called Gopi, who is from Ferozepur in Punjab and whose name came up during the interrogation of one Kuldeep Sharma, arrested with 36.17 grams of heroin on July 20. Gopi currently is on the run. SP (Crime) Ketan Bansal said, “The patterns involved in drug smuggling change frequently. We’ve observed that drugs sourced directly from Punjab are in higher demand these days, in contrast to contrabands supplied from other places. Most of the suppliers we arrested were found involved in cross border smuggling through drones. A few of them already have criminal backgrounds.” SSP (UT) Kanwardeep Kaur, a Punjab cadre IPS officer with experience in border districts, in turn, emphasized the importance of arresting not just the peddlers but also the suppliers, in order to break the back of a drug racket. Kaur said,”We consider our investigation in NDPS Act cases incomplete till the main suppliers are arrested. This approach applies to suppliers from Punjab as well as other states.”"

Backdropped by the flags of their respective nations are the busts of Mahatma Gandhi and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his Bangladesh counterpart, side by side. There are several other memorabilia of Rahman too in the city, where he spent considerable years of his youth. A biopic of his, directed by Shyam Benegal was screened in the city, where its lead actor Arifin Shuvoo, said: “People of Bengal will emotionally connect more with this film than their counterparts in Bangladesh.” There are still resplendent social, linguistic, cultural and political affinities betweenKolkata, West Bengal and Bangladesh. The national anthem of both countries was penned by Rabindranath Tagore, who spent much of his lifetime in Shilaidaha, a town in Bangladesh, where a three-day celebration is held on Tagore’s birth anniversary. The city was the capital in exile for the first Bangladesh government, and at 8 Theatre Road, there is a Mujibnagar Memorial Monument and Complex in remembrance of the signing of the Pakistani Instrument of Surrender.

Nothing perhaps connects the city and the neighbouring country as the cuisine. The tangy aroma of Bangladeshi delicacies hit you when you stroll along the New Market Area. The menu smacks of Bangladeshi identity and bears the names of cities across the border, such as Sylheti Shorshe Ilish (Sylhet Mustard Hilsa), and Chattogrami Chingri (Chattogram Prawn). Almost every restaurant is packed, now that thousands of fans from Bangladesh have descended in the city for its World Cup games, against the Netherlands, which they lost, and the other against Pakistan, scheduled for Tuesday. It’s a complex and fascinating coming together—Bangladesh to duel the country it ceded independence from on the soil of another country it once was part of, and one which is so like them. At the press conference, Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan was reminded of the past. “This is the land for your freedom fighter. What is your vision?” he was asked. He sidestepped the political implications, but history would be peering at him from every corner. All of these layers make the contest between the two engrossing. Bangladesh have endured their most torrid campaign in recent times, winning just one of their six games and effectively out of the World Cup knockouts. Their party-spoiling days seem long, as there is both a paucity of talent as well as planning and organization. Their passionate fans are utterly devastated. “Simple waste of money, We should not have come here to watch them. They don’t deserve to be cheered,” says Tanzid Ahmed, fuming. So incensed the fans were after the Netherlands capitulation that one was spotted slapping the face with his shoes. Most of them did not even wait for the match to end. But there could be a redeeming factor yet for them this World Cup. That is if they could beat Pakistan, who Tanzid considers as the bitterest of their rivals. “I know we have rivalries with both India and Sri Lanka. But nothing would beat that of Pakistan. We will go home happy if we beat Pakistan,” he says. Unlike the other Southeast Asian cricket-bloc rivalries, there have not been too many moments of scandals, though there have always been a nervous intensity, whenever they have clashed. Even more so in the World Cup, where both teams have won a game apiece. Bangladesh did so famously in 1999. After the victory, captain Aminul Islam would say: “This is the match that would change the history of Bangladesh cricket.” A few months on, they became a Test nation, with the considerable backing of the then ICC president Jagmohan Dalmiya. But 24 years on, they still remain as the minnows of the Test world. “We are toothless tigers,” says Rahim Imam, another fan who had come to watch the Kolkata leg. The tiger metaphor is apt for their opponents, Pakistan too. The once famous “cornered” tigers are now “tigers in the abyss”. Their semifinal hopes hinge on the thinnest of threads, which requires them to win their three remaining games by landslide margins and hope that their stars align in the most freakish manner. A defeat to Bangladesh would not only end their road this World Cup, but also would be another indelible scar on the souls. Both India and Afghanistan have already inflicted psychological blows. Failing to beat Bangladesh would be the knockout blow that would set heads rolling in the team. The backlash of the defeats have been brutal back home. Unlike Bangladesh who could salvage their campaign with a victory over Pakistan, they would be disconsolate if they don’t qualify for the semifinals.Inzamam-ul-Haq, the chief selector has reportedly resignedfrom his role over allegations that he was also a shareholder in a prominent player management company. That role had led to conflict of interest allegations. There was pessimism in the voice of coach Grant Bradburn. “We’re in a position that we didn’t want to be. We were determined at this stage of the tournament to be in control of our destiny but we’re not,” he said. All his team could do at this stage, he said, sighing, is to “prepare well for three remaining pool games and then allow fate to be hopefully leaning on us.” He was again quizzed on the lasting effect of theAhmedabadthrashing and the hostile crowd. He would patiently reply: “It was a huge experience for all of our players having never played at that venue before and the unusual experience of playing in front of a 1,30,000 supporters of the opposition.” With just a handful of Pakistan supporters managing visas, while thousands have flocked the city from Bangladesh, the support for Bangladesh would be deafening. However, the Kolkata crowd has strange behavioural patterns. They sparked a riot during the India-Pakistan Test, part of the Asian Championship in 1999. But when Bangladesh encountered Pakistan in the T20 World Cup in 2016, they vociferously supported the latter. How they would behave on Tuesday is still a mystery. But irresistible would be the layers of history and culture when Eden Gardens hosts a game between Bangladesh and Pakistan."

That role had led to conflict of interest allegations. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in a statement that it has set up a five-member fact-finding committee to “investigate allegations in respect of conflict of interest reported in the media pertaining to the team selection process. “The committee will submit its report and any recommendations to the PCB Management in an expeditious manner,” the statement said. The news is a fresh blow for Pakistan cricket, which is already going through a turbulent time with the Pakistan team in 6th spot in the standings of the ongoing Cricket World Cup, having won just two of their six matches so far. “People speak without research. Questions were raised on me so I decided that it was better I resign,” Inzamam was quoted as saying by Pakistan’sGeo News. “People are making statements without research. I told the PCB to do their research. I have no relation with the player-agent company.” At the heart of the controversy is a player-management company called Yazoo International Limited. According to Pakistani websiteCricket Pakistan“Inzamam is a shareholder in Yazoo International Limited, a company owned by players’ agent Talha Rehmani. Rehmani represents some of Pakistan’s top cricketers, including Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, and Shaheen Shah Afridi.” With the Pakistan cricket team in trouble in India, there has been a lot of scrutiny over the team. This has led to people questioning Inzamam’s role as well (he has been chief selector since August). Follow all the action from theCricket World Cup 2023on our special World Cup section.

Head of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) management committee, Zaka Ashraf, recently told a new channel: “It looks like a conflict of interest. We will call the chief selector and ask him to clarify whether this news is correct or not. But it seems like if Talha has controlled seven to eight players, then he must be the one behind the selection as well. We will ask the chief selector to explain.” Ashraf also gave an interview toAry Newswhere he said PCB would devise a legislation regarding business agreements of the cricketers and chief selectors. “Such business agreements could have become a reason for a clash in the team’s interests. The chief selectors will be questioned and legislation will be devised… There would a monopoly if a single agent has contracts of several players. Business agreements and agents are serious issues and the board would consider these issues on a serious note.”"

Mumbai, India– Attending a World Cup is on the wish list of every cricket fan. The opportunity comes once every four years, the wait is long and arduous, it might be expensive – but in the end, it’s worth it. Many fans in India had hoped to attend theCricket World Cupon home soil, but the organisers’ delay in announcing the final schedule and a chaotic ticketing process have forced many to give up on their dream. The International Cricket Council, cricket’s global governing body and organisers of the World Cup, released the fixtures on June 27; just 100 days before thestart of the tournamenton October 5, when defending champions England take on New Zealand in the opener in Ahmedabad. The delayed announcement was met with backlash from fans asschedulesfor the last two ODI World Cups in Australia and New Zealand (2015) and England and Wales (2019) were put out more than 12 months in advance. Then on August 9, less than two months out from the start of the tournament, the 2023 World Cup organisers made things even more complicated for fans by releasing a revised schedule. The dates or start times were changed for nine matches, including the highly-anticipated India vs Pakistan fixture in Ahmedabad, which was moved to October 14 from its original date of October 15. The changes to the schedule werereportedlyover security concerns and requests from participating countries. Match tickets for the general public went on sale in a staggered manner only from August 25, a mere 41 days before the opening match. And the process to book tickets was far from hassle-free – fans had to first register to be able to book tickets and then wait for hours before they could have a chance to buy them. And for many, the chance never came.      Mayank Batra, a cricket fan in New Delhi, had booked a flight for October 15 to attend the India-Pakistan match in Ahmedabad but was forced to cancel it after the fixture was rescheduled. The 28-year-old made a fresh travel booking for the new date, but even that was in vain as he failed to get his hands on the match tickets. “There has been a lot of mismanagement. Several people had already booked their travel and couldn’t get hold of the match tickets,” Batra told Al Jazeera. Batra said his initial round-trip flight tickets cost him 30,000 Indian rupees ($360), but prices went up after the match was rescheduled, with one-way tickets costing 23,000 Indian rupees ($277). “Eventually I cancelled my refundable flight tickets and instead booked train tickets. But I couldn’t get match tickets so my plan didn’t work out,” Batra said. Late changes to the fixture list also led to inflated accommodation costs, with prices for some hotel rooms in Ahmedabad soaring by more than 12 times the usual cost, with rooms as expensive as 53,000 rupees ($637) a night in three-star hotels. Meanwhile, those lucky enough to get their hands on match tickets can also face huge prices. The cost of World Cup tickets starts from 499 rupees ($6) and goes up to 40,000 rupees ($481) on the official ticketing platform. The prices in the resale market are exorbitant, with the most expensive ticket for India vs Pakistan selling for 25 million rupees ($300,545) on Viagogo, a multinational ticket exchange and ticket resale brand. The situation is also likely to affect fans travelling to India from abroad. Some fans from the Barmy Army, an England cricket supporters club, are expected to skip the World Cup due to the difficulty in planning the trip. Meanwhile, fans from other countries face visa difficulties – most significantly for neighbouring cricket-mad Pakistan. Batra, who has travelled across India to watch cricket, said travelling to Sri Lanka last month to watch India play Pakistan in the Asia Cup would have been cheaper. India faced Pakistan twice in the Asia Cup, beating them by 228 runs in the Super Four clash after their group-stage game was called off due to rain. “Even a one-day trip to Colombo would have cost me less than travelling to Ahmedabad [as per the current prices],” Batra said. “The match tickets for that match in Colombo were also very cheap and Indians have visas on arrival in Sri Lanka.”  Anish Desouza, an ardent cricket fan from Mumbai, hoped to attend six matches at the World Cup but had to cancel his plans due to the limited availability of tickets and the high expenditure involved. Desouza, who co-founded the North Stand Gang, a fan group named after the stand they sit in at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium, wanted to attend matches in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Kolkata. But tickets were hard to come by, he said. “The way the ticket sales were handled was very shoddy,” Desouza said. “The waiting in a queue system was very unfair to fans because we had to wait for over four hours only to come to know the tickets were sold out.” Well-travelled sports fan Vipul Yadav described the management of the ticketing process as “nonsensical”. “The amount of time I have spent on booking matches … it’s crazy,” Yadav said. “Nowhere in the world, do you have to struggle so much for a ticket. All this has happened because the ticket release has been done too late.” Yadav will be travelling to Paris for the Olympic Games next year and said the process for booking tickets for that event was very straightforward. “The process was so good, they [organisers] make it so easy for you. They give you a week’s notice about the tickets going on sale, 48 hours to book and also keep slots open for you,” Yadav said. The ICC, which is yet to announce how many World Cup tickets have been sold so far, did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on the issues raised in this article. BookMyShow, the official ticketing platform for the Cricket World Cup, released astatementlast month on X, formerly known as Twitter, addressing the issue of “limited tickets”. “We understand that not all fans had an easy time, experiencing queues and eventually heartbreak in their attempt to book tickets. In a country like India, which is deeply passionate about cricket, the demand is always massive as scores of fans try to book tickets with queues naturally tending to be long,” the company said. “While it is always a race against time to get access to this cricketing extravaganza, we are striving to be able to give you a fighting chance to get access to the tickets.” According to BookMyShow’s website, more tickets for India matches will be “coming soon” and tickets for some matches involving other teams, such as England, Pakistan and Australia, are still available on the platform.    Desouza, who attended the 2011 ODI World Cup in India, said the ticketing process was hassle-free at that time. “The tickets for the 2011 World Cup were available well over a year in advance,” he said. “The process was very smooth. There was no waiting time.” He compared that with his experience of trying to buy a match at the Wankhede Stadium. “Tickets were very hard to come by. When a stadium has 33,000 capacity and you release only 500 tickets, that is ridiculous,” Desouza said. “I am not mincing words because it is surely unfair for fans like us.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Afghanistan, hemmed in by mountains, has a long history of strong earthquakes, many in the rugged Hindu Kush region bordering Pakistan. Death tolls often rise when remote locations are hit, and decades of war have left infrastructure in shambles, making relief and rescue operations difficult. Here is a list of Afghan quakes over the past three decades: BADAKHSHAN, 2023 A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck the sparsely populated northeastern province of Badakhshan, 40 km (25 miles) southeast of Jurm village, killing at least 13 people in Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan. KUNAR, September 2022 As Afghanistan was recovering from strong earthquakes three months earlier, tremors hit Kunar province in September, killing eight. PAKTIKA, June 2022 A magnitude 6.1 earthquake killed 1,036 people in the eastern province of Paktika, causing widespread damage and forcing Afghanistan to appeal for international aid. HINDU KUSH, 2015 A quake of magnitude 7.5, one of the largest in Afghanistan’s recorded history, killed 399 people in Afghanistan and neighbours Pakistan and India. HINDU KUSH, 2002 Twin earthquakes in the Hindu Kush in March 2002 killed a total of 1,100. HINDU KUSH, 1991 An earthquake in the Hindu Kush killed 848 people across Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Soviet Union. QAYEN, 1997 A magnitude 7.2 quake on the border of Afghanistan and Iran killed more than 1,500 in both countries and destroyed more than 10,000 homes. TAKHAR, February-May 1998 An earthquake in the remote northeastern province of Takhar killed at least 2,300 people, with some estimates ranging as high as 4,000. Three months later, a quake of magnitude 6.6 in the same region killed 4,700."

Jaishankar’s remarks came as he addressed the 22nd session of the Council of Heads of Government of SCO at Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. “SCO should work together to promote stability and prosperity in the region by strictly adhering to the principles of international law, respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other and encouraging economic cooperation,” he said in his address. In this context, the centrality of the interests of Central Asian states plays a key role, he said. Beijing is investing billions of dollars in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in Pakistan. India has protested against the projects in Pakistan as it is being laid through the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). He said India shares deep civilisational ties with the people of the SCO region. Currently, the SCO countries include India, Iran, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. “The continuous movement of goods, ideas and people traversing the region has left indelible imprints on our customs, traditions, language and cuisine. These historical relationships should now create a template for greater economic cooperation,” Jaishankar said “To improve trade within the region, we need robust connectivity and infrastructure. Such initiatives should respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries,” he said. “The Global South should not be saddled with unviable debt arising from opaque initiatives,” Jaishankar said, in another jibe at China, which is accused of launching unviable infrastructure projects in countries like Sri Lanka and Pakistan, saddling those countries with debts. At the same time, Jaishankar said that the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) could become “prosperity enablers.” The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, which many see as an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, was jointly announced by the leaders of the US, India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Italy and the European Union on the sidelines of the G20 summit in September. The International North-South Transport Corridor is a 7,200-km long multi-mode network of ship, rail, and road routes for moving freight between India, Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia, Central Asia and Europe. The Global South refers to countries often characterised as developing, less developed, or underdeveloped, primarily located in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Beijing was the lender of choice for many nations over the past decade. Many borrowed heavily from China. There have been global concerns over debt traps and regional hegemony by China using its ambitious Belt and Road (BRI) infrastructure projects. China is doling out huge sums of money for infrastructure projects in countries from Asia to Africa and Europe. The US’ previous Donald Trump administration had been extremely critical of the BRI and was of the view that China’s “predatory financing” is leaving smaller countries under huge debt endangering their sovereignty. During its SCO presidency, Jaishankar said India focused on five new verticals of cooperation- Startups and Innovation, Traditional Medicine, Science and Technology, Youth Empowerment and Shared Buddhist Heritage. The response received highlighted the relevance of the chosen themes.”We adopted a Statement on Cooperation in Digital Transformation and we have also institutionalized a Special Working Group on Startups and Innovation. India is also hosting SCO Startup Forum on a regular basis,” he said."

The two have faced each other on a few occasions, and their battles have always been thrilling. While one is known for his raw pace and ability to regularly clock speeds of over 150 kmph. The other is one of the most technically sound batters in the world with a wide range of strokes with excellent skills of playing pace. However, the duo go back a long way, which Rauf recently recalled when he bowled toVirat Kohlias a net bowler in Australia during India’s tour of Australia in 2018-19. After that, Rauf had made his debut in 2020. Speaking in ESPNcricinfo’s documentary The Incredible rise of Haris Rauf, the Pakistani bowler said: “When I was a net bowler for the Indian team and was bowling to Virat Kohli, I felt like he knew exactly where the ball was going to hit his bat. He was very focussed and that showed how sharp his concentration was.” “Even during practice sessions in the nets, it felt like I was playing a match against him, despite being a net bowler. His remarkable control and intensity made me realise why he has such a reputation in the game.” Earlier, Rauf had also spoken about Kohli’s knock of 82* and the epic sixes that the Indian batter had hit at the MCG and said, “The way he [Kohli] played in the World Cup, that is his class, we all know the types of shots he plays. And the way he hit those sixes, I don’t think any other player can hit a shot like that off my bowling.

The minor, a Muslim, has not been apprehended. The arrests were carried out after the village pradhan filed a police complaint alleging that the girl’s act was part of a larger conspiracy that included her family members and her neighbours. The accused were arrested under Section 151 of the Criminal Procedure Code for attempting breach of peace, the police said. According to the police, the village pradhan lodged a complaint on Tuesday saying that on Monday evening, a jagran was organised at the village crossing by the local unit of the Maa Singh Vahini Durga Pooja Samiti. Late at night, he alleged, a girl from a neighbouring village climbed the stage, threw a black cloth on the idol of the goddess and raised the slogans of ‘Islam Zindabad’ and ‘Pakistan Zindabad’. The pradhan further alleged that the girl also issued a threat of instigating a riot. “The action of the girl in the video shows she was issuing a threat. We still need to check what slogans she raised after climbing the stage,” Basti Circle Officer Sheshmani Upadhyay said. The voice in the video clip provided to the police is not clear, he added. Following the complaint, the girl, her parents, two sisters, two brothers and two of her neighbours were booked under sections 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, a police officer said."

Afghanistan defeated defending champions Englandby 69 runs at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023 to deliver one of the biggest upsets in the tournament’s history. Afghanistan’s English coach Jonathan Trott said it would “take a while [for the result] to sink in” after his side’s unexpected win in New Delhi on Sunday. It was not the first time one of the top-ranked sides had lost a Cricket World Cup match to a less fancied opposition. Here’s a look at some of the biggest upsets in the tournament’s history: India beat West Indies by 43 runs at Lord’s on June 25, 1983 to win their first Cricket World Cup title. They shocked the two-time defending champions in the final of the 1983 tournament, having arrived at the World Cup with just 17 wins in their first nine years as a one-day international (ODI) team. Kapil Dev’s men managed to score just 183 – with the top scorer, Kris Srikkanth, scoring a modest 38 – as the West Indies pace battery of Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, and Malcolm Marshall showed no mercy. But then, Mohinder Armanath (3-12) and Madan Lal (3-31) suffocated the flamboyant West Indies batsmen, with Viv Richards managing the top score of 33 for the side. The title win made Dev and his men overnight heroes in their country as cricket fever truly gripped the South Asian nation. Ireland beat Pakistan by three wickets at Kingston, Jamaica on March 17, 2007, for their first-ever win in the tournament. Ireland marked St Patrick’s Day in style by knocking Pakistan out of the 2007 World Cup in Jamaica after the Irish attack skittled out the Asian giants for just 132, with future England pacer Boyd Rankin taking three wickets. Ireland suffered a collapse of their own before Kevin O’Brien and Trent Johnston saw them to victory. But there was a grim postscript to the match when Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer died in his hotel room that night. Kenya beat West Indies by 73 runs at Pune in the 1996 World Cup. Batting first, Kenya struggled to 166 all out in this group-stage fixture, with Courtney Walsh and Roger Harper taking three wickets apiece. But in what was heralded as one of the greatest ever shocks at the time, the African nation saw opening bowler Rajab Ali claim the prize wicket of Brian Lara for just eight runs. Only Harper and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, whose 19 runs occupied 48 balls, reached double figures for the West Indies who were dismissed for just 93. Maurice Odombe played a captain’s role with 3-15 from his 10 overs. Ireland were at it again in the 2011 World Cup, beating England by three wickets in Bengaluru. England were knocked over by a then-fastest World Cup century from Kevin O’Brien as the Irish showed their giant-killing powers once again. Trott, Afghanistan’s current coach, was at the receiving end of a shock as one of the top England batters in India in 2011. England piled up a seemingly imposing 327 for eight, with Trott making 92 and Ian Bell 81, although John Mooney’s four-wicket haul prevented a larger total. In reply, Ireland lost skipper William Porterfield before they could score a run, but Kevin O’Brien seized his chance to shine by smashing a World Cup hundred off just 50 balls, with 13 fours and six sixes. After he was out, Mooney’s 33 not out sealed a stunning win with five balls to spare. Bangladesh beat India by five wickets at Port of Spain, Trinidad in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2007. India’s star-studded batting lineup, comprising the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh, was bundled out for 191 runs thanks to an impressive bowling display by pacer Mashrafe Mortaza and left-arm spinner Abdul Razzak. A young Bangladeshi opener by the name of Tamim Iqbal announced himself on the world stage by taking on the Indian bowling in his 51-run knock. The then-18-year-old was helped by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim and another star-in-the-making Shakib Al Hasan as they took their side home in a historic win over their bigger and mightier neighbours. Bereft Indian fans showed their anger at home by burning effigies of their star players.          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

[+] Yadav-ICC/ICC via Getty Images) When India and Pakistan meet on the cricket field, the stakes are amplified to an extent that perhaps is unparalleled in sports. Given the intense political situation for the nuclear-armed neighbors, who have fought three wars against each other since becoming independent nations in 1947, they sadly rarely play each other in cricket. Only in major events do they clash with administrators doing everything they can to milk this ridiculously hyped contest. It's easy to see why. Previous contests between the arch-rivals over the past decade have been watched by a viewership of between 300 million to 500 million. In other words, it's cricket's money-spinner but means so much more for these well populated countries, combining more than 1.6 billion people many of whom are cricket obsessed. Matches between the countries affects the national psyche of the countries and used as a political football by the warring governments. The politicking was well and truly in force for the India-Pakistan blockbuster in Ahmedabad on Saturday in a headliner of the World Cup's early stages. The match was Pakistan’s first in India in seven years. Rohit Sharma starred for India (Photo by Alex Davidson-ICC/ICC via Getty Images) This marquee contest, which stops the entire cricket world and evokes fascination for the global media, was an opportune moment for emerging powerhouse India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi to flex its political muscle. It was little surprise that the match was held at the mega 132,000-seat, aptly named, Narendra Modi Stadium. There was a rather pompous ceremony held before the game, which was all a bit strange for a group game amid the tournament's bloated scheduling. Senior politicians and cricket's most influential administrators dotted the ground amid a sea of blue as basically the entire crowd of around 120,000 fans - a record for a cricket match - supported India, who lived up to their favouritism with a seven-wicket thumping in an anti-climax. The partisan crowd was no surprise given Pakistan fans have been all but blocked from attending. Inevitably, given the icy relations, there has been ugliness in the background. Pakistani journalists have mostly not yet been granted visas to cover the event and there was controversy when a popular female presenter walked away from her role on the official broadcast and abruptly left the country. The Pakistan team had themselves endured visa delays to India in the aftermath of a tense standoff with Pakistan at one point threatening a boycott of the tournament. Jay Shah, Indian cricket's all-powerful boss, is the Home Minister Amit Shah’s son with the department responsible for vetting visa applications. Shah, who essentially rules cricket with an iron fist, was unsurprisingly in the terraces amid the bedlam and surely giddy over India's crushing victory over their rival with the whole world watching. Jay Shah is India's cricket boss (Photo by MONEY SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images) A one-sided contest didn't look likely initially. When the match finally got underway, as all the bickering and bad blood was put to the background momentarily, Pakistan's top-order were able to subdue a rowdy Indian crowd. They looked set for a strong total until losing their last eight wickets for just 36 runs to be bowled out for a lowly 191. It proved nowhere near enough with India captain Rohit Sharma continuing his commanding form with 86 from 63 balls to spearhead his team's third straight win with almost 20 overs to spare. India have remarkably won all eight games against Pakistan in the tournament's history. When Shreyas Iyer hit the winning runs, triggering a deafening crescendo and cementing his team's title credentials, India had well and truly flexed their muscle on the field to fittingly cap a grandiose spectacle that had ripple effects well beyond cricket."

While the project has drawn$1 trillionin its first decade, according to estimates from think tank Green Finance & Development Center, the momentum has tapered off in recent years. China’s overall activity in BRI countries is down about 40% from its 2018 peak as the world’s second-biggest economy slows. Beijing faces accusations of being an irresponsible lender driving countries to default. Fractured ties with the U.S. have made association with Xi’s pet project increasingly divisive—Italy, its sole Group of Seven member, is set to exit by the year’s end. One Chinese official considered the BRI dead, dealt twin blows by Covid and China’s economic problems. The official, who asked not to be identified discussing a sensitive topic, said the government hoped this summit to mark BRI’s 10th anniversary would reinvigorate the project. Read More:Bye Bye BRI? Why 3 New Initiatives Will Shape the Next 10 Years of China’s Global Outreach The U.S. assesses that the BRI is in deep trouble, according to a senior American official who asked not to be identified to discuss private conversations. Beijing has less capital to lend and pressure is growing to recoup the outstanding money it loaned, the official said. Xi will have the chance to answer his critics when a host of Global South leaders arrive this week to pledge support for the program and test Beijing’s bandwidth for new deals—chief among them Russian President Vladimir Putin. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Argentina’s President Alberto Fernandez, andThai Premier Srettha Thavisinare also attending. “Xi will invite his best friends and have all these people come together to celebrate,” said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. “It’s a clear message that China is trying to have its own allies while challenging the U.S.-led world order.” The outbreak of Covid put the brakes on China’s infrastructure and trade initiative, as a global slowdown imperiled debtors’ ability to repay their loans. Zambia was the first African country to default during the pandemic in late 2020, putting China, the nation’s largest creditor, in the spotlight. As other nations including Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan fell into debt crises, annual engagement under the BRI plummeted to $63.7 billion in the first year of the global health crisis, according to astudyby the Green Finance and Development Center at Shanghai-based Fudan University—down from a peak of more than $120 billion in 2018. That pullback has been sustained by geopolitical tensions and domestic problems plaguing China’s economy, which show little sign of abating. Read More:China Faces a Familiar Economic Downturn. But Its Crisis Is Worsened by the War in Ukraine “External shocks like the Ukraine war and, perhaps in the coming weeks the new war in the Middle East, are deepening debt and inflation burdens,” said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. China has responded by shifting to so-called “small but beautiful” projects that benefit people’s livelihoods. The state-run People’s Daily this month cited a water plant in Botswana upgraded by a Chinese firm and a technology partnership with a seed company in Costa Rica asexamples. The average BRI investment deal decreased by 48% from the 2018 peak to about $392 million in the first half of this year, according to the Fudan report. The report tracks both the value of construction projects that are funded by China as well as those that Chinese companies have equity stakes in. China’s private companies are also becoming more active in a space once dominated by policy banks and state-owned companies, said Christoph Nedopil Wang, director of the Griffith Asia Institute, who authored the Fudan study. That’s resulted in some big investments with a focus more on global markets than building infrastructure. China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. and Mercedes-Benz Group AG, for example, plan to invest more than $7 billion in a plant in Hungary, the biggest single project in a BRI country since it started in 2013. Yet the Belt and Road initiative has always been loosely defined, with the label often applied to any projects in nations with friendly ties to China. The strategy’s geographical focus has also evolved in step with Xi’s foreign policy. Saudi Arabia was a top three recipient of BRI lending this year, according to the Fudan study, as the Chinese leader seeks toexpand his influence in the Middle East. Still, Italy has questioned whether Xi’s flagship initiative brings economic benefits at all. “We have exported a load of oranges to China, they have tripled their exports to Italy in three years,” Italy’s Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said in July. “Paris, without signing any treaties, in those days sold planes to Beijing for tens of billions.” After Italy signed an agreement to cooperate on the BRI in 2019, its imports from China accelerated but that bump wasn’t reciprocated. Last year, Italian exports to China only rose 5%, lagging behind those of Germany and France—two countries that aren’t in the BRI. Hungary’s Orban said after a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Monday that his country is looking to boost cooperation with China. “Instead of blocs and shutting out, Hungary’s goal is to develop economic cooperation,” Orban said, adding that China is the biggest source of foreign direct investment this year. China’s Foreign Ministry hasn’t announced plans for a leader’s roundtable that Xi hosted at the two previous events, as the summit looks set to attract a smaller crowd of world leaders. For Global South nations, Xi’s efforts to pitch his country as a leader of the developing world has been a vital source of funding. China extended $114 billion in development financing to Africa alone from 2013 to 2021, according to astudyby Boston University. That spending spurred the U.S. and European governments to expand engagement with some developing nations to counter China’s influence. But while Western rivals have pledged billions of dollars, many of their projects have been slow to get off the ground. China’s credit lines will be tested this week when Kenya’s leader William Ruto isexpectedto ask for $1 billion to finance stalled infrastructure projects. Wu Peng, department director of African affairs at China’s Foreign Ministry, said this month a “big loan” for a new railway project in Africa will be announced soon. That won’t be enough to reverse the overall trend of a downsized BRI, but may signal Xi’s ongoing commitment to the program as a linchpin of his foreign policy. Even with the slower pace of investment, Xi’s imprint means BRI won’t fade away, according to Raffaello Pantucci, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. “Xi being associated with it so closely, means it’s going to stay an important and relevant thing for as long as he stays in power,” Pantucci said. The pace was probably “too fast at the beginning anyway.”"

Launched in 2009 by veteran Indian journalist Prabir Purkayastha, NewsClickdescribesitself as “one of India’s most consistent chroniclers of diverse people’s movements and struggles.” It employs less than a hundred journalists and has a social media following of just over 70,000. During the early hours of Tuesday morning, Delhi police raided the homes of at least 30 staff, including editors, reporters, and freelancers, to question them under an anti-terror law called the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act before seizing all electronic devices including personal mobile phones and laptops. The police also arrested Purkayastha, along with NewsClick's head of human resources, Amit Chakravarty, over allegations of money laundering. On Wednesday, sixteen journalists and news organizations, including the press clubs of various cities across the country, wrote a joint plea to the Indian Supreme Court Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud to ask the judiciary to intervene. They say the raids are the latest example of the attacks leveled against the press by the current government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. “The fact is that today, a large section of journalists in India finds itself working under the threat of reprisal,” the letterstated. NewsClick claims to report on news and views ""ignored by corporate media, whose agenda is dictated by the rich and powerful in the country."" In the past, its journalists have ruffled feathers by reporting contentious stories like the farmers' protest in 2020 and the government’s overhaul of history textbooks this past April. Abhisar Sharma, a prominent Hindi-language journalist with nearly three million subscribers on YouTube, recently reported on a caste census carried out in the northern state of Bihar that contradicted the government’s claims, while Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, another veteran journalist, has become critical in exposing the government’s ties with the Indian billionaire, Gautam Adani. Read More:India's School Textbooks Are the Latest Battleground for Hindu Nationalism As a result, the news outlet has been under the watchful eye of Indian authorities since 2021,  when Delhi police first alleged that it was violating Indian laws on foreign direct investment by receiving funding from an American company. In February of that year, the Enforcement Directorate, the federal agency overseeing money laundering claims,raidedNewsClick’s offices along with Puryakastha’s home. In August, areportfrom the New YorkTimesclaimed that according to corporate filings, NewsClick had been financed by Neville Roy Singham, a U.S. millionaire accused of working closely with Beijing and financing its propaganda internationally. The report also stated that the Indian news outlet had “sprinkled its coverage with Chinese government talking points.” Indian authorities have since seized on these claims to register a case against NewsClick and its journalists. The New YorkTimeshas also come under scrutiny for its role in publishing the story that led to the police crackdown, with protests held outside its offices on Tuesday. In astatementpublished Wednesday, NewsClick rejected all the allegations leveled against it, adding that it still hadn’t received a copy of the First Information Report that outlines official police charges, as required by law. It pushed back against money laundering charges by saying that in the last two years, authorities haven’t called on Purkayastha for questioning, nor filed any charges against the outlet despite possessing all of its information, documents, and communications. It also addressed the New YorkTimes' claims by saying that it doesn’t publish any news or information “at the behest of any Chinese entity or authority, directly or indirectly,” or “propagate Chinese propaganda on its website.” It added that the government is attempting to “shut down and stifle independent and fearless voices that portray the story of the real India—of peasants, of laborers, of farmers, and other oft-ignored sections of society.” Along with the letter to the Supreme Court Justice, several national and international news organizations have expressed concerns about the raids, saying they are reminiscent of the 1975 Emergency when the voices of those critical of the then-ruling Congress party were silenced through arrests, detentions, and raids. Many also point to shrinking press freedoms in India. Since Modi came into power in 2014, India has drastically slipped places from 140 to161 out of 180in the annual World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders, coming below countries like Laos, the Philippines, and neighboring Pakistan. Read More:Why India Is Using Emergency Laws to Ban a Documentary About Prime Minister Modi In official statements, the Press Club of Indiasaidit was “deeply concerned” about the raids, adding that it stood in “solidarity with the journalists,” while the Editor’s Guild of Indiaurgedthe government to “not create a general atmosphere of intimidation under the shadow of draconian laws” by following due process. The Network of Women in Media Indiastatedthe government should be “transparent about its actions” and not use anti-terror laws indiscriminately against journalists and dissenters, while Digipub, a news foundation in India,saidthe raids had taken “the government’s pattern of arbitrary and intimidatory behavior to another level.” “India has been in a downward spiral on press freedom and other rankings on civil liberties and human rights, and the Indian government’s war against the media is a blot on the world’s largest democracy,” Digipub added. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has also called for the immediate release of Purkayastha, urging the government to “stop trying to intimidate journalists” through tactics like police raids. “This is the latest attack on press freedom in India,”saidBeh Lih Yi, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator. “We urge the Indian government to immediately cease these actions as journalists must be allowed to work without fear of intimidation or reprisal.”"

Saturday’s 6.3 magnitude 6.3 quake killed and injured thousandswhen it levelled an untold number of homes in Herat province. Picking through the rubble on Monday, Asadullah Khan paused to think about a future marred by grief. Khan lost three daughters, his mother and his sister-in-law. Five members of his uncle’s family have died. His neighbours are grief-stricken, too. “We have lost 23 people in this village,” Khan said. The Taliban-appointed deputy prime minister for economic affairs, Abdul Ghani Baradar, and his team visited the quake-affected region on Monday to deliver “immediate relief assistance” and ensure “equitable and accurate distribution of aid,” authorities said. Top United Nations officials also went to Zinda Jan to assess the extent of the damage. In neighbouring Pakistan, the government held a special session to review aid for Afghanistan, including relief teams. Afghanistan has few reliable statistics but a spokesman for Afghanistan’s national disaster authority, Janan Sayiq, told reporters in Kabul that about 4,000 people were killed or injured by the disaster. He did not provide a breakdown, but the UN estimates that 1,023 people were killed and 1,663 people injured in 11 villages in Zinda Jan alone. Nearly 2,000 houses in 20 villages were destroyed, according to the Taliban. The area hit by the quake has just one government-run hospital. The epicentre was about 40 kilometres (25 miles) northwest of the city of Herat, the provincial capital, the US Geological Survey said. Several of the aftershocks have been strong, including one on Monday that again caused residents of the city to rush out of their homes. More than 35 teams from the military and nonprofit groups are involved in rescue efforts, said Sayiq, the disaster authority spokesperson. The fast-approaching winter, combined with the new disaster, is likely to exacerbate Afghanistan’s existing challenges and make it even harder for people to meet their basic needs, like adequate shelter, food and medicine, aid groups warn. Vital infrastructure including bridges was destroyed and emergency response teams have been deployed to provide humanitarian assistance, the International Rescue Committee said. Afghans are still reeling from recent natural disasters. A magnitude 6.5 earthquake in March struck much of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and an earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan in June 2022, flattening stone and mud-brick homes and killing at least 1,000 people.

Just like it played out against England. “He is expecting the short ball and many times, even against short-of-length balls which aren’t ideal for pulling, like the one against England, he goes for the shot. So, you are overthinking about the short ball and you are in trouble,” Misbah said on ‘A’ Sports. “See his front foot. After the initial movement, it goes nowhere. And he is in no position to play the short ball … And he doesn’t even try to avoid the short ball.” Follow all the action from theCricket World Cup 2023on our special World Cup section. You can also find the lateststats, like thetop scorerand thehighest wicket-takerof the current edition, upcomingWorld Cup fixturesand thepoints tableon the site. The length from Chris Woakes wasn’t that short, more like top of back of length, butShreyas Iyerfirst took a tiny forward movement, arrested it, and then went a bit pear-shaped in the way he opened himself up as he went for the pull. Unsurprisingly, the bat-flow wasn’t smooth, neither was the bat-face ideal, and the ball ballooned up for a simple catch. The mental make up of Shreyas is such that he is avoiding the most sane option available for him: ducking or swaying away from the short ones; he commits himself so much into the shot that he is almost unable to tear away. Former Pakistan captain suggested that India take a serious look at their batting order, and promoteKL Rahulat No.4, instead of Shreyas. “I have been saying from day 1, KL Rahul is a class player and is late at No.5; he should be batting at No.4 … If they have KL Rahul at No.4 and then when Hardik Pandya comes back, things can get difficult for Shreyas,” Misbah said. It’s a touch tricky. If this world cup was played on bouncier tracks of South Africa or England, then it would have been an easy decision to go the way Misbah suggests and take Iyer out of middle-order fire. But in Indian conditions, the team values his approach. The wayRohit Sharmaand India see Shreyas is a bit different from how the regular No.4 batsman is viewed traditionally. They are quite happy with the way he counterattacks at the start, shifts the momentum from the opposition if early wickets fall. By doing that, even if he doesn’t carry on for bigger scores, Shreyas sets up the innings for the likes of Rahul and Hardik Pandya (or Suryakumar Yadav). In case he falls early, then Rahul has the skill to drop anchor. Shreyas at No.4 allows them to delay that anchoring, milking the middle-overs. India’s first preference is to attack, and Shreyas allows them that luxury. Their batting order is also arranged that way: Rohit Sharma attacks, Shubman Gill is more naturally brisk rather than taking any risks. Then Shreyas Iyer attacks whenVirat Kohlitakes up the Gill like brisk shepherded role. Similarly, Rahul takes up that manoeuvring role while Pandya/Suryakumar can attack. It even follows down asRavindra Jadejatakes up that singles-rotation steering role, allowing his partner to hit out. If Shreyas is taken out of No.4, then it can lead to a situation where Rahul and Kohli are bunched together. Not that it’s bad – both of them together have pulled India out of holes even in this world cup, but with Shreyas in the mix, it allows them for a greater attacking or counterattacking cameo that helps them in setting up big targets or chasing down tall scores. Speaking toThe Indian Expressbefore the world cup, Rohit Sharma expounded on the No.4 position and the role of Shreyas. “We have Shreyas Iyer. It’s just that due to his injury, and a couple of players we tried didn’t grab the opportunities, the ‘hawaa’ once again returned but since I knew Shreyas would be back, I had no sleepless nights over it. He has been perfect for us … Ever since the last ODI World Cup, it  [the No.4 problem] has followed us. And perhaps it was a problem during Virat (Kohli) and (Ravi) Shastri’s time, but I can speak confidently for us (Rohit andRahul Dravid), that it hasn’t been an issue at all,” Rohit told this newspaper. Will the last couple of games make Rohit rethink that? He is usually the sort who gives a longer rope and doesn’t over-react to the situations. Considering India’s position in the world cup, it’s likely that Shreyas will get more games to prove himself. It will now come down to how Shreyas views it. Will he try to be even more bolder and frantically aggressive to prove a point, or would he tame down a touch, and consider swaying or ducking from the short balls until he settles down. It’s not easy, of course, as if in his mind he sees himself as a counter-attacker, he is almost drawn into the battle from the get-go. Pacing an innings is an art that only the real best know and Shreyas isn’t there quite yet. His effort to keep the ball down can also be a touch awkward – with the bat face neither here nor there as he tries to roll his wrists over the ball but wouldn’t quite manage that. Not that he is unaware of the issue. “That (the short ball issue) is just what the commentators talk about. And off-the-field guys kept saying it was an issue. It had gone into my head at one point. But if you see, if I can leave or keep it down, I definitely don’t have a problem. Runs wouldn’t come (against short balls); that was the situation. Obviously the bowlers started to target when I came to bat. It does play in batsmen’s mind when people from outside talk about the problem and it’s important as a player to turn a deaf ear to them. The rest will take care of itself. At the end of the day, ignorance is bliss.” Turning deaf ear to others is often a good thing in high-profile sports, but perhaps the inner ear can be tuned in to listen to his own words: “If I can leave or keep it down, I definitely won’t have a problem”. But his aggressor role that he and the team have defined for him gets in the way. Fascinating times ahead in the next couple of matches to track how he bats."

This summer, I visited my village in Jaghori district in Ghazni province for the first time since 2017. I had never been so at ease while travelling from Kabul to my birthplace. Just a few years ago, undertaking this 260km trip meant risking one’s life. In 2009, for example, on my way to the village with some relatives, our car got caught in the crossfire of a battle between Afghan forces and the Taliban. We narrowly survived. This time around, I travelled without witnessing any explosions or fighting or being stopped and searched at a checkpoint. When I arrived, I was struck by how much my village had changed. I hardly recognised the place. It looked almost deserted. My relatives and friends had all left. The house I grew up in was occupied by strangers – internally displaced people from another province. The streets were empty; I saw just a few lonely children roaming around. The village of my childhood looked completely different. It was full of people and full of life, with crowds of children running in the streets and playing. Our favourite place was the local stream, which was surrounded by greenery and attracted all kinds of birds and small animals. There was a small dam, deep enough for us children to swim and play in. Women would come to the stream to chat and catch up on gossip while filling up their jugs with water to carry home. During prayer times, the men would also show up to do their ablutions. Water from the stream irrigated the nearby fields. Villagers grew wheat, potatoes, beans and other vegetables; they also kept orchards of apricot, apple and plum trees. Eager to remember those good times, I rushed to the stream, but what I found was devastating. Prolonged droughts had reduced it to a trickle. The green, lively valley of my childhood was no more; in its place lay a dry, silent strip of parched land. The fields lay mostly barren, as there was not enough water to irrigate them; I could see just a few orchards here and there still being kept. The once bustling community of 170 people now has no more than 40 left, most of them internally displaced people – too poor to make it to urban centres or abroad. I found a few of the original residents – old people, whose children and grandchildren had left for the country in search of a better life or had moved to bigger cities like Kabul and Herat. I felt nostalgia for the good old days, but also an uneasy premonition for what the future holds for my country. I realised that the depopulation and desolation I saw in my village are the reality in many places across rural Afghanistan. Decades of conflict have pushed almost a quarter of the Afghan population of 40 million to flee abroad. The return of security to the country after the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021 has certainly made a difference in the lives of many Afghans and given us hope for better times. It has enabled humanitarian access to all provinces, including the areas which had been out of reach for decades. But this has not resulted in refugees rushing to come back to the country. According to the UNHCR, some 1.3 million out of 4.5 million IDPs have returned to their home areas since August 2021 and some 6,000 registered refugees came back voluntarily to the country last year. The growing hostility against Afghans in neighbouring Iran and Pakistan, which host the majority of refugees from my country, has not resulted in a large movement of people returning home, either. The recent announcement of a crackdown on “illegal immigrants” by Pakistan’s Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti is likely to put more pressure on Afghan refugees. But many of them, especially those who lived in Pakistan for years, have no homes in Afghanistan to return to and would find it hard to survive in a country, where unemployment is rife. If the Pakistani authorities act on their threats and deport Afghans, it is unlikely many of them would stay in Afghanistan. They would most likely attempt to leave again. In response to the announced crackdown, the Taliban’s spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahidwrote on X: “The behavior of Pakistan against Afghan refugees is unacceptable. The Pakistani side should reconsider its plan. Afghan refugees are not involved in Pakistan’s security problems.” This indicates that the Taliban government also realises that the country cannot provide for a large number of returnees. Two years have passed since the war ended, but Afghanistan is still struggling to recover. Worse still, another menace is on the horizon, which is as dangerous as a conflict but cannot be resolved with arms. Climate change has stricken Afghanistan, prolonging droughts and shrinking the already limited water reserves of the country. Between 1950 and 2010, temperatures in Afghanistanrose 1.8 degrees Celsiuson average – about twice as much as the rest of the world. Rainfall across the country has fallen by as much as 40 percent. In 2018, as the war between the international coalition and the Taliban was still going on,droughts displacedsome 370,000 Afghans – as many as the conflict did. Dry spells have decimated the rural areas, destroying harvests and depopulating villages like my birthplace in Jaghori district. There is little hope for these areas. As the effects of climate change worsen in the coming years, the depopulation of Afghanistan will likely continue. People from rural areas will flock to the big cities, fleeing hunger and increasing exponentially the population of the urban poor. Those Afghans who have the means will continue to try to leave the country in search of better economic opportunities. Sadly, more unique places that used to be filled with life – like my village – will be lost.

Booker Prize-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy could be prosecuted for a 2010 speech about Indian-administered Kashmir after a top official signed off on the move, reports say. Roy, 61, is one of India’s most famous living authors, but her writing and activism, including her trenchant criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, has made her a polarising figure at home. A criminal complaint accusing her and several others of sedition had languished in India’s notoriously glacial criminal justice system since it was first filed in 2010. But on Tuesday, Indian media reported that VK Saxena, the top official in the administration governing New Delhi, had given approval for the case to proceed before the courts. Saxena’s directive said there was enough evidence for a case to proceed against Roy and Sheikh Showkat Hussain, former professor of international law at Central University of Kashmir, “for their speeches at a public function” in the capital, local media reports said.      The original complaint accused Roy and others of giving speeches advocating the secession of Kashmir from India, which partly governs the disputed region and claims it in full, along with neighbouring Pakistan. Kashmir is one of the most sensitive topics of public discussion in India, which has fought two wars and countless skirmishes with Pakistan over control of the Himalayan territory. Tens of thousands of people, including Indian troops, fighters and civilians, have been killed in Indian-administered Kashmir since a rebellion against Indian rule broke out in 1989. Roy’s home in New Delhi was besieged by protesters in 2010 when her remarks from the panel discussion became public. Two of her codefendants – Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Syed Abdul Rahman Geelani, a Delhi University lecturer – died in the 13 years since the case was first lodged. Roy became the first non-expatriate Indian to win the prestigious Booker Prize for her acclaimed debut novel, The God of Small Things, in 1997. She is also known for her passionate essays on the plight of the poor and dispossessed in India, occasionally earning the ire of the country’s elite. In recent years, her work has marked her as one of the most high-profile critics of Modi’s government, which has been accused by rights groups and others of targeting activists for criminal prosecution and working to suppress free speech. Reporters Without Borders warns “press freedom is in crisis” in India. Since 2014, India dropped from 140 to 161 on its rankings of media freedom, including 11 places since last year.

Top of the ladder! The control, the pace, the variations, just a complete bowler. A treat to watch,” Akram told the A Sports. “With the new ball, to get this kind of movement on this kind of pitch … pace, carry, follow-through… you name it he’s a complete bowler,” he added. Akram also explained what make Bumrah so lethal and why he has better control with the new ball than him. “When Bumrah is bowling to a left-hander from around the wicket and hits the ball on the seam… And when he’s bowling from wide of the crease, the batter will think the ball is coming inside. “He will play for that angle, but the ball hits the pitch and moves away rather than coming in. Most of the time, you are going to be beaten. “When I used to bowl outswingers like that to right-handed batters with the new ball, sometimes I couldn’t control the ball also. But Bumrah definitely has better control with the new ball than myself,” Wasim said with a smile. “The length where he bowls with the new ball is what creates uncertainty for the batters.” “Bumrah ka ek hi ilaaj hai uspe pressure daalne: uske spikes chori karlo. Aur koi hal nahi hai (There’s only one way to put pressure on Bumrah. Steal his bowling spikes. There’s no other cure),” joked Wasim. Former Pakistan skipper Misbah too heaped praise on Bumrah. He said: “Besides the swing, the line and length of his balls is at a spot that the batter has no chance.” Akram also said the Pakistani bowlers should learn from Bumrah and play more Test matches. “Why Bumrah is more lethal than Pakistan bowlers, because he plays more Test cricket, while our bowlers they don’t play in the longer format enough,” said Akram. If it was Bumrah, who set the tone for India againg England but it was Shami’s opening spell 4-1-5-2 that knocked them down.Mohammed Shami, who bagged a five-wicket haul against New Zealand in Dharamsala took four more wickets against England. “What a World Cup Shami is having! Look at how on every ball the seam hits the deck,” Akram said. Misbah explained why Shami is so lethal and why English batters struggled inLucknow. “If I look at it as a batter, you can manage to negotiate swing! You can see the ball leaving the hand.

Police have registered anFIRagainst nine persons — the girl, her parents, her elder sister (adult) and her three other minor siblings. Two of her neighbours, both adults, have also been named in the FIR and arrested. The teenage girl and three of her minor siblings —all belong to a different community — have not been detained. The accused have been booked under IPC sections 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 506 (criminal intimidation), police said. The arrests were made after the village pradhan filed a police complaint alleging that the girl’s act was part of a larger conspiracy that included her family members and her neighbours. The accused were arrested under Section 151 of the Criminal Procedure Code for attempting breach of peace, police said. According to the police, the village pradhan filed a complaint on Tuesday saying that on Monday evening, a jagran was organised at the village crossing by the local unit of the Maa Singh Vahini Durga Pooja Samiti. Late at night, the pradhan alleged, a girl from a neighbouring village climbed the stage and raised “pro-Pakistan” slogans. The pradhan also alleged that the girl also issued a threat of “instigating a riot.” However, the Basti police claimed that preliminary inquiry indicates that the llegation that the teenaged girl raised “pro-Pakistan” slogans was false. “An investigation is underway and on the basis of evidence, the next course of action will be taken,” he added. “The action of the girl in the video indicates that she was issuing a threat. We still need to check what slogans she raised after taking the stage,” said a senior police officer. The voice in the video clip provided to the police is not clear, he pointed out. According to a local resident, on Monday late evening, a large crowd gathered at the village crossing to witness the jagran. Suddenly, two girls from a neighbouring village climbed the stage and one of them entered into an argument with the person performing. He added that following the intervention of elderly persons, the matter was then resolved and girls were removed from the stage. The jagran concluded peacefully. The next day, some residents filed a police complaint over the issue. Alleging that no action was taken, some residents later staged a protest at the crossing. Hearing about the protest, a police team arrived. The protest was called off after police assured action would be taken. “The girls deliberately took the stage to create a nuisance. There is a conspiracy behind the move,” alleged thevillage  pradhan.  The village has around 80 per cent Hindu population. The girl’s uncle, however, claimed, “There is no conspiracy behind my niece’s’ act. I have come to know through local residents that during the ritual, someone allegedly made objectionable remarks against our community. My niece then went on the stage and raised an objection over this.”"

The actor feels by doing this, the country will be able to get rid of “lazy” and “irresponsible” people. While speaking at News18 Amrit Ratna 2023, Kangana suggested the best way to make people disciplined in the country is by giving them military training. “We will get rid of these lazy and irresponsible people if military training is made compulsory in the country for every child after graduation. It will inculcate discipline in them,” said Kangana. During the interaction, the Manikarnika star also questioned Bollywood stars and cricketers befriending their contemporaries in ‘enemy’ countries. The actor said she has often heard soldiers question the behaviour of Bollywood celebrities and cricketers. “Our soldiers ask when Bollywood is showcasing its love for artistes of China and Pakistan, cricketers are hugging them, then am I the only one who thinks of them as enemies? Is the animosity between the two countries only for me? This is why we have made Tejas. It showcases how a soldier feels when people of the country talk behind his back while he is fighting at the border,” expressed Kangana, while adding that the basic thing that needs to be done at the ‘micro-level’ when “our soldiers are troubled on the border” is to “boycott” the foreign goods immediately. Kangana Ranaut will be next seen in themilitary drama Tejas. The film’s trailer was released on October 8, on the occasion of Indian Air Force Day. Kangana portrays the role of Air Force pilot Tejas Gill in the movie. The trailer showcases her senior officers entrusting her with a high-stakes mission to rescue an Indian engineer-turned-spy held captive by terrorists in Pakistan. Written and directed by Sarvesh Mewara, Tejas is scheduled to hit theatres on October 27. Click for more updates and latestBollywood newsalong withEntertainment updates.

 Men dug thr… [+4346 chars]",Pakistan,"Men dug through rubble with their bare hands and shovels in western Afghanistan Sunday in desperate attempts to pull victims from the wreckage left by powerful earthquakes that killed at least 2,000 people. Entire villages were flattened, bodies were trapped under collapsed houses and locals waited for help without even shovels to dig people out. Living and dead, victims were trapped under rubble, their faces grey with dust. A government spokesman said Sunday that hundreds were still trapped, more than 1,000 hurt and more than 1,300 homes destroyed. “Most people were shocked ... some couldn’t even talk. But there were others who couldn’t stop crying and shouting,” photographer Omid Haqjoo, who visited four villages Sunday, said. Saturday’s magnitude 6.3 earthquake hit a densely populated area near Herat. It was followed by strong aftershocks. A Taliban government spokesman on Sunday provided the toll that, if confirmed, would make it one of the deadliest earthquakes to strike the country in two decades. An earthquake that hit eastern Afghanistan in June 2022, striking a rugged, mountainous region, wiped out stone and mud-brick homes and killed at least 1,000 people. The US Geological Survey said the quake’s epicentre was about 40 kilometres northwest of Herat. It was followed by three very strong aftershocks, measuring magnitude 6.3, 5.9 and 5.5, as well as lesser shocks. With much of the world wary of dealing directly with the Taliban government and focused on the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, Afghanistan hasn’t received an immediate global response. Almost 36 hours after the first earthquake hit Herat province, there have been no planes of aid flying in, no specialists. Who is helping Afghanistan? The International Rescue Committee warned that the lack of rescue equipment could push up the death toll in western Afghanistan because trapped survivors cannot be freed. “There’s not much disaster management capacity and what there is can’t cover people on the ground,” said Salma Ben Aissa, the committee’s country director for Afghanistan. “The numbers (of dead) are increasing hour by hour.” People injured in the quake on Saturday can’t get the treatment they need because of poor medical infrastructure so they are losing their lives. A lack of food, shelter and clean water is increasing the health risks among communities. Ben Aissa’s colleague, Jawed Niamati, said Herat city is empty. People are sleeping in the open air, on roadsides and in parks, because they fear more quakes. Temperatures drop to 10 degrees Celsius at night, he said. At least a dozen teams have been scrambled to help with rescue efforts, including from the military and nonprofit organisations like the Red Crescent. The United Nations migration agency deployed four ambulances with doctors and psychosocial support counsellors to the regional hospital. At least three mobile health teams were on their way to the Zenda Jan district, which is one of the worst-hit areas. Doctors Without Borders set up five medical tents at Herat Regional Hospital to accommodate up to 80 patients. Authorities have treated more than 300 patients, according to the agency. UNICEF dispatched thousands of supplies, including winter clothes, blankets and tarpaulins as temperatures dropped. Some aid groups, like the World Food Program, were already on the scene with essential items. Later Sunday, people from surrounding villages brought equipment to support rescue efforts. Save the Children said the scale of the damage was horrific. “The numbers affected by this tragedy are truly disturbing – and those numbers will rise as people are still trapped in the rubble of their homes in Herat,” said the aid group's country director for Afghanistan, Arshad Malik. “This is a crisis on top of a crisis. Even before this disaster, children were suffering from a devastating lack of food."" He called for an ""urgent injection"" of money from the international community. Neighboring Pakistan said it was in contact with Afghan authorities to get an assessment of the urgent needs. China's ambassador to Afghanistan, Zhao Xing, said his government and the country's charitable institutions were ready to provide all kinds of help. “We are in contact with Afghan government aid agencies to provide aid to the needy,” he said on X, formerly known as Twitter."

The bill to end ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, approved in the lower house last week, will now be sent to Putin for final approval. Putin has said that revoking Russia's 2000 ratification would ""mirror"" the stance of the US, which signed but did not ratify the nuclear test ban. State television showed Putin directing the exercise via video call with top military officials. Russia's Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu said the purpose of the drills is to practise ""dealing a massive nuclear strike with strategic offensive forces in response to a nuclear strike by the enemy."" Increased US-Russia tension While similar drills are held every autumn, Shoigu's pointed comments came amid soaring tensions between Russia and the West over the fighting in Ukraine. The test ban treaty, adopted in 1996, bans all nuclear explosions anywhere in the world, but the treaty was never fully implemented. In addition to the US, it is yet to be ratified by China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel, Iran and Egypt. There are widespread concerns that Russia could move to resume nuclear tests to try to discourage the West from continuing to offer military support to Ukraine. Many Russian hawks have spoken in favour of a resumption of the tests. Putin has noted that while some experts have argued that it's necessary to conduct nuclear tests, he hasn't yet formed an opinion on the issue. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said earlier this month that Moscow will continue to respect the ban and will only resume nuclear tests if Washington does it first. Ryabkov said Wednesday that the Russian Foreign Ministry had received US proposals to resume a dialogue on strategic stability and arms control issues, but noted that Moscow doesn't consider it possible in the current political environment. ""We aren't ready for it because the return to a dialogue on strategic stability ... as it was conducted in the past is impossible until the US revises its deeply hostile policy course in relation to Russia,"" Ryabkov told reporters in comments carried by Russian news agencies.

Thousands of people who worked with or for the UK government in Afghanistan and fled the Taliban are in Pakistan, waiting for relocation to the UK. Some have been waiting for over a year, according to charities.  Earlier this month, Pakistan said it plans to start deporting illegal migrants from 1 November. Among the Afghan refugees in Pakistan are former translators for the British army and teachers for the British council, all part of either the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme or Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy. All went to Pakistan because the UK asked them to go to process their visas ready to start a new life in the UK.  But many of the refugees' visas have now expired. And according to a risk assessment document revealed in court, the British authorities in Pakistan now consider people in this group to be ""at risk of deportation"". Recent government figures show that around 3,250 men women and children on the UK's relocation schemes are living in guest houses and hotels in Pakistan's capital Islamabad.  While in Pakistan, they have no legal access to work and their children are not allowed to go to school. Initially many thought they would be in Pakistan for a few weeks.  Documents released in court revealed how many face longer waits in part due to instructions by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, banning their accommodation in hotels in the UK in all but extreme cases.  Instead, longer-term accommodation was to be found. An email released in the documents stated that this ""should represent an overall net saving to the taxpayer"". Over the past few weeks the BBC has spoken to people on the UK's relocation programmes; many said they are afraid to leave their hotels.  According to official sources in Pakistan, the UK government is now planning on chartering several flights over the course of the next few months, until December. The officials have said the first of these flights starts on Thursday.   The UK government has not said how many people will be onboard the first flight or how many are expected to be relocated before 1 November deadline.  The BBC understands that the government has decided that those on the relocation programmes will no longer need to be matched to so-called ""suitable accommodation"" before they arrive.  There was some hope, but also confusion about the news of the flights.  Jamal, not his real name, worked as a translator for the British army, and said he had not heard anything from the British authorities.  ""Hopefully everyone will move soon, no one knows who is first, who is in the middle, who is last,"" he told the BBC. Mahfouz, also not his real name, worked delivering projects for the UK government. ""I am just concerned what will happen if my family will not be on one of those flights until the end of December.  ""My wife is pregnant and if we don't travel soon we may have to wait into next year,"" he said.  Those on the UK schemes are becoming increasingly nervous about the 1 November deadline.  Several told the BBC on at least two occasions where they had heard of police raiding accommodation and detaining people on the UK relocation schemes, who did not have the suitable documents to hand.  Even though they were released, it has left many frightened they could be sent back to Afghanistan.  The Taliban government has declared an amnesty for those who worked with international forces.  However, many people we spoke to talked about living in hiding before they left Afghanistan for Pakistan, scared, they said, of what might happen to them.  Some felt that by following the UK authorities' directions and leaving Afghanistan they had put themselves at increased risk.  Qasim - not his real name - worked with the UK authorities.  He said: ""Before we left Afghanistan, our lives were in 50% danger. Now they are in 100% danger."" The UK authorities' risk assessment also acknowledges that things may change after 1 November.  The document states that they have stood a ""reasonable chance of success"" of securing release, if notified in time of someone on the scheme's detention. But that ""it is very difficult to judge we would be successful in every case if it were to happen frequently beyond 1 November and we were not informed or the eligible person didn't have the documents with them."" A UK Ministry of Defence spokesperson did not comment on the flights but said the UK had brought around 24,600 people from Afghanistan to safety, including thousands of people eligible for the country's Afghan schemes.

This film weaves various  generational narratives together, shedding light on the age-old war between convention and personal aspirations. This is a heartfelt ode to women of different eras who journey through the challenges and triumphs that bind them. The film starsAmrit Kaur,Nimra Bucha, and Hamza Haq. The film follows Azra (Kaur), a Pakistani Canadian who isn’t concerned with conformity. Naturally, her parents Miriam (Bucha) and Hassan (Haq) aren’t happy with her choosing acting classes and an LGBTQ lifestyle. It is these choices that leave mother and daughter estranged. When her father dies, Azra travels from Canada to Pakistan to mourn with her family. Reconnecting with her mother, Azra is privy to some family history as her mom discusses her personal rebellious streak in 1969.Related StoriesReviews'Polite Society' Review: A Cultural Action Adventure Film Complete With Martial Arts And WirefuBreaking News'The Sex Lives Of College Girls': Pauline Chalamet, Amrit Kaur, Renée Rapp, Alyah Chanelle Scott To Lead HBO Max Comedy Series From Mindy Kaling As a young woman, Miriam is fiercely independent, looking for love and looking to carve her own path. When Miriam and her family move from Pakistan to Canada, there is a familial shift as they have to adjust to a new life, and assimilate into the western work force. At one point, Miriam sells tupperware door to door to make ends meet. It is through these flashbacks that the audience learns how mother and daughter became estranged, and also how the past can be the key to making amends in their future. In the cinematic universe where stories are often linear and themes monochromatic, Fawzia Mirza’sThe Queen of My Dreamsemerges as a delightful anomaly. The film explores the complexities between then and now, a tussle many diaspora families are all too familiar with. What sets this movie apart is its refusal to stick to the beaten path. It’s less about the destination and more about adventure – the unexpected detours that make you pause, think, and, laugh. The only issue is the movie spends more time in the past than it does in the present, which deprives the viewer from really getting to truly know Azra, and layers of empathy and understanding that we seek feel amiss in these moments. However, there is enough information to surmise who Azra was, is, and who she will be in the future. Lit up with the vibrant hues reminiscent of the golden age of Bollywood, which include strong, conventional lighting techniques and color palettes, It’s evident that Mirza and cinematographer Matt Irwin desired to frame this narrative in the most opulent and stylish way. These moments are a favorite of mine because there is just something about that period in time that captures all the senses. The Queen of My Dreamsis a film that doesn’t shy away from wearing its heart on its sleeve. Its endearing charm radiates not only from its affectionate nod to Sharmila Tagore, or its love affair with Bollywood, but also from its dedication to narrating the tales of multiple generations of women who examine, reflect, and celebrate their experiences.  Mirza directs with colorful fervor that will resonate with  viewers, making them feel a part of its world, even if for a short time.

When Virat Kohli finally hit a six off Bangladesh bowler Nasum Ahmed to complete his 48th one-day-international (ODI) hundred, the crowd at Pune’s MCA stadium erupted in a joyous roar. Kohli finished his unbeaten innings with 103 runs from 97 balls inIndia’s seven-wicket win over Bangladesh, their fourth consecutive of the tournament, on Thursday Meanwhile on social media, cricket fans and experts weighed in on the manner in which the last few balls of India’s innings panned out. Once the former India captain had reached 81, he turned down at least five singles and his batting partner Rahul later explained why. “He (Kohli) was confused, he said, ‘It’ll not look too nice not to take the single, it’s still a World Cup, and it’s still a big stage. I don’t want to look like I am just trying to get the milestone,'” Rahul told the tournament broadcaster. “But I said, I mean it is not won but still I think we’ll win quite easily, so if you can get to the milestone why not, you must try. And he did that in the end. I wasn’t going to run the singles anyway.” Rahul scored 34 runs and remained unbeaten as well. One of the bigger sticking points was when – with India two runs short of the target of 257 and Kohli on 97 – Ahmed fired a ball that went wide down Kohli’s leg side but umpire Richard Kettleborough did not signal a wide. Some comments on X, formerly Twitter, suggested that the umpire was “in on the charade”. “A stone cold wide down the leg side is not given by the on field umpire, who then smirks,” cricket writer Peter Della Penna wrote in a post. “If Kohli wants to turn down singles in pursuit of a century, so be it, but it raises integrity issues when an umpire refuses to call a blatantly obvious leg side wide in order to assist Kohli in his personal escapade.” If Kohli is turning down singles with 7 wickets in hand and 10 overs left purely so he can get a century, I'd bowl 5 wides down the leg side if I'm a Bangladesh bowler. No more nonsense from any cricketer big or small about ""I play for the team."" — Peter Della Penna (@PeterDellaPenna)October 19, 2023  One sarcastic comment termed the race between Kohli’s century and India’s target “the first close game of this World Cup”. Others said Kohli was well within his rights to pace the innings as he liked as “India were never going to lose”. Completely disagree with this. 1. India were never going to lose. 2. It’s extremely unlikely they’ll need NRR to separate themselves from other teams in the table.3. The century made his fans happy.4. Round numbers are cool and universally praised. What’s the problem?#CWC23https://t.co/GBuVbsxc3P — Dan Liebke (@LiebCricket)October 20, 2023  However, former Pakistan bowler Wasim Akram heaped praises on Kohli for switching gears with ease as he neared his first ton of this World Cup and third in all World Cup matches. “They [Kohli and Rahul] were enjoying batting, toying with the bowlers with at a healthy run rate,” Akram said on a post-match television show when asked about the criticism aimed at Kohli. “He [Kohli] was running quick doubles when he was in his 80s and 90s, despite having fielded for 50 overs, which is unbelievable,” Akram said. “That guy is from a different planet.” The 34-year-old’s last century in the Cricket World Cup came against Pakistan in 2015, but former India batter Mohammad Kaif said Kohli was an expert in “the art of run-making in ODIs.” When Virat Kohli wants a 100, he gets it. So what if India needed just 169 to win when he came out to bat. Few understand the art of run-making in ODIs like him.@imVkohli#ViratKohlipic.twitter.com/L0X5lgITPy — Mohammad Kaif (@MohammadKaif)October 20, 2023  The star batter is now one behind his compatriot and idol’s world record of 49 ODI centuries. “I wanted to make a big contribution today,” Kohli said after the match. “I have a few half-centuries in World Cups but didn’t convert them. I wanted to finish off things today and stay till the end.” Kohli said it was a “special feeling” to play the tournament at home. India are second on the points table as they trail leaders New Zealand on net run rate. The two teams will face each other in Dharamsala on Sunday. Fantastic performance by@imVkohli!

Caste is not specific to India, and no country, regardless of whether it is fundamental to its reality, should be limited to a single social group. However, comprehending caste in Pakistan requires an understanding of the demography of caste, the intricacies of which are undeniably complex. While it may not be one of Pakistan’s most visible social aspects, it underlies many of the country’s historical and contemporary challenges. The Hindu population in Pakistan is a small minority, making up around 1.2 per cent of the total population. A significant proportion of Hindus in Pakistan belong to the Scheduled Castes. Approximately 40 distinct castes exist in Pakistan, with 32 of them formally designated as Scheduled Castes under the November 1957 Presidential ordinance. Scheduled Castes are mainly associated with Hindu communities, reflecting the influence of the supremacy of upper-caste Hindus. The challenges of discrimination against Dalits are primarily prevalent in rural areas, where a significant portion of the population lacks literacy and awareness about human rights. These discriminatory practices are primarily carried out by local feudal lords and sections of the upper-class Hindu population residing in rural areas. The legacy of caste-based exclusion in Pakistan has deep historical roots that existed in the sub-continent centuries before the country came into being. While the Constitution and legal frameworks were established to protect the rights of religious minorities and marginalised communities, discrimination persists. The story of Basanti Meghwar’s family is heart-wrenching. For more than two decades, they have been victims of bonded labour, trapped in brick-making to pay off the debt incurred when they borrowed money from a kiln owner to cover a hospital bill. Due to the absence of clear documentation, they are vulnerable to exploitation through such practices of modern-day slavery. However, civil society has been trying to help and influence government decision-making. Pannu Fair, a bonded labourer since the age of eight, was freed and his debt cleared through a court order. The intervention of SPARC, a local NGO, helped him to find a way to freedom. Dalits are disproportionately affected by bonded labour, primarily due to factors such as poverty, their caste status, and being non-Muslim, which further contribute to the challenging socio-economic conditions faced by the very segment. While the intensity of discriminatory activities against Dalits in Pakistan may not be as extreme as in some other countries, these practices still exert negative impacts on their lives, contributing to their social marginalisation and exclusion. The discrimination they face lead to their curtailed participation in political processes, including discouragement from contesting elections or freely exercising their voting rights. Forced conversion in Pakistan is yet another distressing issue that highlights the vulnerability and challenges faced by marginalised communities. Despite ongoing challenges and systemic exclusions from mainstream society, some determined individuals of the Dalit community have managed to rise high and make an impact on society. Sono Khangharani, with over three decades of experience in microfinance and development, has made a significant impact on society by leading and developing organisations that work with diverse groups. His commitment towards transformative change has created opportunities for marginalised individuals in the community. Additionally, Krishna Kohli’s journey from being a bonded labourer to becoming the first Hindu Dalit woman to be elected to the Senate, from Nagarparkar in Sindh province, is a remarkable story of resilience. Growing up in a deprived village, she faced poverty, hunger, and was subjected to forced child labour. However, her determination enabled her to break free from this cycle and be an inspiration for others. These success stories highlight that individuals from Dalit communities have resilience and potential for growth and if given equal chances, they can rise to higher positions, contributing to a more inclusive and equitable society. Some other influential figures have called attention to issues faced by Pakistan’s Dalit population. A local Dalit, Radha Bheel, CEO of RADHA (Rural Advancement Development Human Rights Association) and Chairperson of Dalit Sujag Tehreek, has emphasised the lack of political participation and economic disparities faced by Dalits in Pakistan. Another human rights activist, Pushpa Kumari, has pointed to the intersecting factors of gender, caste, and social position. Pirbhu Satyani, a human rights advocate from Sindh, has often spoken of the limited public discourse on caste discrimination in Punjab. To tackle these concerns, the Government of Pakistan, particularly the Sindh government, has undertaken a range of laws and programmes to address the difficulties experienced by minority communities. Despite the presence of legislation aimed at protecting minority groups, efforts are needed to effectively implement these laws. Dalits in Pakistan aspire to bring a transformative change where systems and authorities that support and promote such exclusionary practices for personal gains can be challenged. Only then can a future that guarantees greater security and safeguards their rights be attained.

Afghanistan have defeated Sri Lanka by seven wickets in Pune to record their third win of the Cricket World Cup and boost their hopes of a semifinal place. Their bowlers had laid the foundation of their third win in six matches on Monday when they bowled out Sri Lanka for a below-par 241 in 49.3 overs. Three of their top five batters, including Hashmatullah Shahidi, then produced half-centuries in a clinical chase that they accomplished in 45.2 overs to move to fifth place in the points table. Azmatullah Omarzai (73) scored the winning run with Shahidi (58) looking on from the other end. Shahidi and his men hadstunned holders Englandand1992 champions Pakistanearlier in the competition, and they proved those were no flukes with yet another impressive display against 1996 winners Sri Lanka. Put into bat, several Sri Lankan batters got their eyes in but could not quite capitalise on those starts. After the fall of Dimuth Karunaratne in the sixth over, Kusal Mendis (39) forged half-century partnerships with Pathum Nissanka (46) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (36) to steady the innings. At 134-2 in the 28th over, Sri Lanka looked well placed to reach the 275 mark, but the plucky Afghans struck at regular intervals to peg them back. Angelo Mathews and Maheesh Theekshana raised 45 quick runs for the eighth wicket, but Sri Lanka still fell short of the 250 mark. Afghanistan lost Rahmanullah Gurbaz in the first over, but Rahmat Shah (62) and Ibrahim Zadran (39) calmed the nerves with a 73-run partnership.  Kasun Rajitha dismissed Shah, but not before the batter had brought up his second successive fifty of the tournament. Shahidi and Omarzai mixed caution with occasional aggression in their unbroken century stand to take Afghanistan closer to the target. With victory in sight, both decided to play their shots, and Omarzai scored the winning run when he attempted to hit a six and was dropped at deep mid-wicket. “Quite happy and proud of the team,” Shahidi said after the match. “The chase was very professional and I am very happy about it.” Sri Lanka captain Mendis rued his side’s poor total after their fourth loss in six matches. “I think we were a little bit short of runs,” he said. “We needed 280 or 300 on this pitch. I think the bowlers did well in the first 10 overs, but it was tough after that.”           Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Last week, Pakistan’s interior ministry said that migrants residing in the country illegally were given 28 days to leave on their own accord and that“rewards”would be offered for information on those who do not go by the October 31 deadline. The move prompted an outcry from some human rights groups, who said that deportations of Afghans would put them at risk in the Taliban-led country. A joint statement from the International Organization for Migration and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees acknowledged Pakistan’s“sovereign prerogative”over its domestic policies. Still, it said a forced exodus could threaten migrants’ wellbeing. Islamabad, however, has denied that the policy explicitly targets Afghan refugees. “We have been hosting Afghan refugees generously for the past four decades,”Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, said on Friday. She added that the policy is aimed at“individuals who are here illegally, no matter what their nationality is”and that any suggestion to the contrary is a“misunderstanding.” The UN said the plan would have“serious implications for all who have been forced to leave the country and may face serious protection risks upon return.”In August, the intergovernmental organization reported that hundreds of members of Afghanistan’s former US-backed government have been detained, tortured, or killed by the Taliban administration since it seized power in 2021. Pakistan’s crackdown on illegal migrants comes at a time of increased hostilities between the government in Islamabad and Taliban authorities in neighboring Afghanistan. In the past 12 months, Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist activity from groups within Afghanistan and others who have traversed into the country following Taliban-led crackdowns. In a news conference last week, Pakistan’s caretaker interior minister, Sarfraz Bugti, said that Afghans were responsible for 14 of 24 terrorist attacks in the country in 2023.“These are attacks on us from Afghanistan, and Afghan nationals are involved in these attacks,”Bugti said last week. About 1.7 million Afghans live in Pakistan illegally, according to Islamabad officials. These include around 600,000 who fled the country after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021, according to United Nations estimates."

Ahmedabad, the largest city in the western Indian state of Gujarat, is the venue for what is being billed as the biggest game in the 48-day-long tournament. The match will take place at Narendra Modi Stadium, the world’s largest cricket ground. The one-day international match, which could last as long as nine hours, is taking on extra significance as it will be the first time in seven years that Pakistan has played in India following years of deteriorating relations between the two cricket-mad countries. With accommodation scarce, many cricket-crazy fans went as far as approaching hospitals located nearby for a place to stay overnight. The match was initially scheduled for October 15, but because the Hindu festival Navratri starts on the same day, the game was moved up by a day to ensure tight security arrangements. The Indian government has beefed up security arrangements for the high-profile match, having deployed around 11,000 personnel for the game. According to Indian media reports, hospital authorities have reported an unprecedented uptick in inquiries from cricket fans, many of whom will be Indians coming from out of town and seeking a one- or two-night stay at their facilities. The daily cost of a stay in the private hospitals in the vicinity varies between 3,000 Indian rupees ($36) and 25,000 Indian rupees ($300), inclusive of food and a comprehensive medical examination. At a conservative estimate, Ahmedabad has around 5,000 rooms in the five-star category and 3,000 in the three-to-four-star category, besides other options such as AirBnB, and heritage and home stays. However, this is insufficient for the thousands of cricket fans who will be descending on the city over the weekend. Prices of hotel rooms in Ahmedabad for the day of the match have risen more than 20-fold, with costs now exceeding 59,000 Indian rupees ($709). Similarly, the prices of domestic air tickets to Ahmedabad have also gone through the roof – by anywhere between 100-400%. Meanwhile, in September, resellers were offering tickets for the match for as high as 5.7 million Indian rupees ($69,000). The cricket frenzy, which coincides with the Hindu festive season of Diwali, is likely to give a temporary boost to India’s economy as consumers splurge to enjoy their favorite sport. Spending related to the 45-match tournament could add up to 200 billion Indian rupees ($240 million) in the third quarter of this year, which ends December 31, Reuters reported. Many Pakistani cricket fans who bought the much in-demand tickets for the grudge tie have yet to get Indian visas but may not be eligible for a refund for their ‘no-show’ on Saturday. Meanwhile, the Pakistan cricket team received a rapturous welcome when it landed in India’s Hyderabad on September 28 for the first time in seven years. The two countries’ head-to-head cricket series has been on hold since 2013. India’s last tour of Pakistan was for the Asia Cup tournament in 2008. India, one of the pre-tournament favorites to lift the cup, has defeated Pakistan in all seven World Cup encounters since the two teams first clashed in Sydney, Australia, in 1992. The host nation has won the trophy twice — the first time in an upset win against the mighty West Indies in 1983 and then in 2011, when the tournament was last played on home soil. Pakistan lifted the trophy once in Australia in 1992 under the captaincy of its cricketing hero-turned-embattled politician Imran Khan. The final of the tournament will be played in Ahmedabad on February 19, where many expect a repeat clash between India and Pakistan."

What Savdas witnessed later is what he describes as “violence of the scale he has never seen before” as a citizen of Israel for 27 years. At Petah Tikva city on Friday – when the first batch of 212 Indians evacuated from Israel landed inDelhi, as the conflict continued for the seventh day – Savdas quietly went about his business, stocking his grocery store and welcoming customers amid odd sirens warning about approaching Hamas missiles. Speaking withThe Indian Expressover phone, Savdas, who immigrated to Israel in 1990 and acquired an Israeli citizenship in 1996, said: “In our part of the city, sirens start wailing sometimes. But there has been no such warning for the last 48 hours and a semblance of normalcy has returned. Public transport is running and supply of daily essential items have not been affected so far. But the situation is horrible in areas along the border with Gaza strip.” While Savdas’s children moved to Canada to study in August, with their mother, Jivabhai’s are in the US. Before immigrating to Israel, Savadas was a farmer in Kothadi village in Junagadh’s Manavadar taluka. He was the second from the family to move to Israel. His elder brother Jivabhai had immigrated to Israel in 1986 and got Israeli citizenship in 1992. Savdas runs a grocery store each at Petah Tikva near Tel Aviv, the commercial hub of Israel, and Jerusalem, the national capital and 98 km away from Sderot, the Israeli city on the Gaza border. He’s also a partner in two other similar stores. He said that Israelis have always lived on the edge but he has not seen violence on such scale. “Warnings of approaching missiles and rockets is nothing new. Never two consecutive months pass without one sort of violence or other. But I have not seen such violence in my life. The situation is terrible in areas along the border. The feeling here is that this is worse than the Holocaust as Hamas militants are not sparing even pregnant women, children and elderly.” Savdas, who didn’t go for higher education after studying science at high school, added: “Israel has suffered such casualties in the 1967 war. But those casualties were over a period of six days and mostly soldiers had fallen. But this time round, they killed a similar number of civilians within six hours. One senior officer of the Israeli secret service who used to live in Petah Tikva is among the casualties. Therefore, Israelis are very very angry.” He said that Hamas militants struck when people were celebrating the last day of the week-long Feast of Tabernacles, a festival of harvest. “People pitch tents during the festival, get together to celebrate and pray. Hamas struck early in the morning when many soldiers were praying, unarmed,” said Savdas. “I returned from Canada on October 3 after making arrangements for daughter Riya, sons Shivam and Rahul to study there and for my wife Rina to stay with them. But on October 7, my daughter called me from Canada and woke me up, asking if I was asleep in the bunker or in my bedroom… she told me that her friends in the IDF had alerted her about the attack by Hamas.” Incidentally, Riya’s two-year-long conscription had ended in July. Jivabhai’s 22-year-old daughter Nitza, too, had completed her draft around a year ago and has since moved to the US for higher studies. The two cousins were the first persons of Gujarati origin to serve in the IDF, Jivabhai said, adding they were with the forces during clashes between IDF and Hamas militants in May 2021. Savdas said the violence has remained limited to up to 10 km on the Israeli side of the border with Palestine at Gaza Strip. He added that the 2,000-odd Gujaratis, mostly from Saurashtra, working as caregivers to the elderly in Israeli don’t feel threatened. “Those who are being evacuated by the Indian government are mostly tourists and students as well as those working in Israel who had already planned a trip back to India but their flights have been cancelled,” Savdas said. The caregivers agree. “I came to Israel as it offers the best wages and security. The violence notwithstanding, I feel Israel is the safest country. I would stay put and wouldn’t mind even serving on the frontlines,” said Raju Odedra (35), a native of Kuchhdi village in Porbandar, who has been giving care to an 88-year-old Israeli in Jerusalem for the last nine years. “My monthly salary as a caregiver here is higher than what I would earn in a year in India,” he added. Odedra used to run a general store in Kuchhdi. His brother Savdas Odedara is also a caregiver in Israel while his wife, two children and parents are in Kuchhdi. Mukesh Karena (37), a native of Pachhtar village in Devbhumi Dwarka’s Bhanvad taluka, has been working as a caregiver in Bat Yam city. “There is tension on the border but in our parts, things look normal more or less. It is just like violence inJammuand Kashmir and the situation in the rest of India,” Karena said. “…every building in Israel has a bunker or safe room and we move there as soon as sirens start wailing,” he added. In Petah Tikva, Raju Kuchhdiya, manager of Savdasi’s grocery store, said that customer footfall has remained normal. “There is no rush from people to stock essential items. The customer flow is normal… I ride a Metro to reach our store and I haven’t felt any threat so far,” said Kuchhdiya, a native of Kuchhdi, who has been working in Israel for six years. Besides the caregivers, Jivabhai said, around 30 Gujarati families associated with the diamond business also live in Israel. In Gujarat, however, the families said they are concerned. “They tell us they are safe and that the war zone is some 40-45 km away. But Israel is a small country and therefore, one remains worried,” said Keshubhai, the second brother of Jivabhai and Savdas. Jivabhai said his children Nitza and sons Rit and Adip are in distress. “One of Nitza’s friends, the daughter of our neighbour and Nitza’s comrade during her draft, is among those killed after terrorists attacked a music party in Be’eri Kibbutz,” he added."

What stood out in the clamour … [+8289 chars]",Pakistan,"Social media accounts spread pro-Israel content as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks closer ties with Israel. On October 7, within hours of the armed group Hamas launching a surprise attack on Israel, social media platforms were rife with support for Israel – and also fake news. What stood out in the clamour was the fact that a fair amount of it was produced and distributed by accountsfrom India. In the days after Israel declared war on Hamas, a blue-tick-verified handle posted a video on the social media platform X of aPakistani parliamentarianthreatening to obliterate Israel with an “atom bomb” if it did not end its atrocities against Muslims. That video received more than 840,000 views. Butit was from 2021and is not related to the current war. Similarly, Suresh Chavhanke, editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, a right-wing channel, shared a clip on X of an Israeli representative tearing up a 20-page United Nations report documenting human rights violations. That toowas from 2021. Experts say the Israel-Hamas war has given a massive reach to social media accounts in India – both large and small – that have managed to ride a wave of anti-Muslim and pro-Israel fervour. Apoorvanand, a Delhi University professor who goes by one name, perceives a link between current “anti-Muslim sentiment” and the rise of Hindu nationalist ideologies like Hindutva, particularly under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Hindutva supporters, he said, “hold Muslims across countries responsible for all the ills and everything bad. They’ve started looking at Israel as an ideal, as a model to be followed because Israel does what it wants to do to Muslims”. A “generational shift” has taken place in India, said Nicolas Blarel, an associate professor of international relations at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Over the last decade, Blarel has observed that the country has grown more fascinated with Israel, including how it defends itself against attacks from its neighbours. That situation has particular resonance in India, according to Blarel. In addition to border incursions from China in the east, India has also been subject to attacks on its western flank by what it says are state-supported armed groups in Pakistan. The two nuclear-armed nations have been locked in an ongoing conflict for control of the disputed territory of Kashmir. Those tense international relations have, in part, led Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to seek warmer relations with Israel. “Terrorism is the thing that’s brought the BJP closer to Israel over the last few years – how to better deal with counterterrorism,” said Blarel. As a result, India’s political sphere has transformed from “an exclusive pro-Palestine ecosystem to the complete opposite and to one that is completely empathetic with [the] Israeli position” today, he explained. Indeed, India had supported Palestine’s right to statehood since 1947, when it gained independence from the United Kingdom. At the time, the United Nations had proposed a “partition plan” to create separate Israeli and Palestinian states, something India objected to. The plan never took effect, though. The very next year, Israel declared independence, sparking a conflict that would see the mass displacement of Palestinians. Still, in 1974, India became the first non-Arab country to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the “sole and legitimate representative” of the Palestinian people, continuing its pattern of support. And while New Delhi formally recognised Israel in 1950, it only normalised diplomatic relations in the early 1990s. Even then, it remained committed to the Palestinian cause and continued nurturing its relations with the Muslim-majority nations in the Middle East. However, in the past few years, India and Israel have startedinching closer. The attacks in India’s financial capital Mumbai on November 26, 2008, helped spur the shift. More than 160 people were killed and over 300 injured. A Jewish centre, the Nariman House, was among the targets: An Israeli American rabbi and his wife were among the six gunned down there. India blamed the attacks on a Pakistan-based armed group. Trade and innovation have also drawn the two countries together. When Modi was chief minister of Gujarat, he displayed his fascination for Israeli technologies including drip irrigation and water desalination, both useful for his state. Israel has also been a supplier of arms to India, including during its 1999 skirmish with Pakistan in the Kashmiri region of Kargil. Israeli surveillance drones and mortar shells helped India emerge victorious in that conflict. More recently, India was one of the countries accused of having bought Pegasus spyware from the Israeli cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group. Critics accuse the Modi government of deploying the spyware against judges, journalists, activists and political leaders, among others. Experts agree that the biggest shift in India’s foreign policy towards Israel has happened since Modi came to power in 2014. He became the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel in 2017. In the wake of the Hamas attack on October 7, Modi has issued strong declarations in support of Israel. He initiallytweeted, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families. We stand in solidarity with Israel.” In a follow-up statement later that day, Modi added that “India strongly and unequivocallycondemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations”. But neither statement made any reference to the lives or plight of Palestinians. Only five days later did his government address the question of Palestinian relations: In response to a question during a routine media briefing, a spokesperson for the foreign minister said India’s stance on Palestine had not changed. “I was struck by Modi’s response to express solidarity with Israel and say nothing about Palestine at all,” said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington, DC. “Because India’s policy has been balanced so far.” The statements showed “total support for Israel to defend itself”, according to Ashok Swain, head of the department of peace and conflict research at Uppsala University in Sweden. While New Delhi is now trying to maintain a more balanced position, those early statements showed that Modi is more interested in getting votes and appealing to his right-wing constituency, Swain added. They send the message that Muslims are “the perpetrators of all sorts of crimes and less than human beings. They don’t talk about the Gaza situation or even who created Hamas”. Swain also sees the statements as a demonstration of the common ground Modi shares with far-right politicians in Israel. “Hindu nationalists and Zionists have an ideological similarity: They want a strong state and a strong leader,” he explained. “They also have a common factor – Islamophobia – which also binds them together.” Those tensions played out on social media in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war.   At Al Jazeera’s request, the Narrative Research Lab in New Delhi scanned through trending hashtags and phrases in India on the social media platform X, to better understand how political narratives about the war were being shaped. The phrase “We Indians” stood out partially because of the ongoing Cricket World Cup but also because of the conflict, said Sarabjot Singh, the lab’s co-founder. “We Indians” is an expression often invoked to stir nationalist pride. Using it as a keyword, Singh’s co-founder Sundeep Narwani used artificial intelligence to analyse a total of 4,316 tweets, of which 2,200 included words about the Israel-Hamas war. More than 1,250 were pro-Israel, and approximately 250 were pro-Palestine, indicating a five-to-one ratio in favour of Israel. In an attempt to gauge social media chatter, the lab also analysed two hashtags:  “#IstandwithIsrael” and “#IsraelPalestineWar”. The former was used globally, but the lab found a “substantial” number of Indian accounts using it. “Issues that bring Modi and Netanyahu together are the same issues that make the Hindutva constituency in India gravitate towards Israel – admiring how Netanyahu has negotiated the neighbourhood with a strong stance,” said Kugelman.

Nonetheless, senior officials in Islamabad also condemned West Jerusalem for the “brutalization” of Palestinians. “We are concerned about the human cost of the escalating situation,”the country’s foreign ministry said in a statement. It added that Islamabad had been“consistently”calling for a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. “A viable, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine should be established on the basis of pre-1967 borders,”the ministry said. Pakistani President Arif Alvi called for“an immediate ceasefire.”He wrote on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday that peace could not be achieved“without condemnation of usurpation and brutalization of Palestinian rights and people by Israel.”He went on to accuse Israel of the“continuous annexation of land.” On Saturday morning, Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israeli cities and military outposts. The Israel Defense Forces responded to the barrage of rockets and ground incursions with airstrikes on Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that his country was“at war”and vowed to turn all the sites used by Hamas“into rubble.” The death toll of Israelis and Palestinians is above 300 dead on each side, according to officials from both sides."

… [+16432 chars]",Pakistan,"As cricket’s marquee event kicks off in India, its ambitions to spread beyond the Commonwealth are on test. Packed stadiums. Raucous crowds. Hooting vuvuzelas. The stage is set for cricket’s biggest carnival, which kicks off in India on October 5 with10 nations competingfor the World Cup over six weeks. On the surface, the numbers suggest a global event: Withover one billion fans, cricket is among the world’s most popular sports. But almost five centuries after the earliest recorded reference to cricket in southeast England, the sport’s market largely remains limited to a handful of countries, led by India. The sport spread with the British Empire, with the first international matches played in the second half of the 19th century. Yet, even as cricket has evolved over the years withchanges in rulesand the introduction of new formats and competitions, it has struggled to expand its reach beyond Commonwealth countries. India, Australia and England dominate as cricketing powerhouses on the field while also holding significant positions of power off the field in the governance structures of the sport. Apart from the ‘Big Three’, other major cricketing nations include Pakistan, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Bangladesh and Caribbean countries that play together as the West Indies. And that’s about it. Football’s governing body FIFA boasts more than 200 member nations. The International Cricket Council (ICC), by contrast, has only 12 full members, with dozens of other nations as associate members. The50-over World Cup, for long cricket’s marquee event, has swung between accommodating more teams – a record 16 participated in the 2007 edition – and limiting participation to a select band of top-performing nations, as will be the case this time around. The next edition, in 2027, will see 14 teams battle it out, but that’s still a much smaller number than the 32 nations that have competed in the football World Cup since 1998. In fact, 48 will feature in the next football World Cup in 2026. So, can the World Cup fire up interest in cricket beyond countries that already love the sport? Or are shorter formats, like 20-overs-a-side competitions – known as Twenty20 (T20) cricket – the vehicles that can propel support around the world? Does cricket even have a global future? The short answer:Cricket does have scope to grow, but it is unlikely to become a global phenomenon anytime soon. And more than the 50-over World Cup, it is the three-hour spectacle of T20 cricket that is the way forward, say experts, especially with the emergence of franchise leagues in new markets such as the United States. Women’s cricket can also help improve the sport’s global footprint, while a possible return to the Olympic Games might serve as a boost. Unlike football, playing cricket involves high expenditure – be it buying the necessary gear, setting up stadiums or maintaining pitches. “Cricket has a relatively high barrier to entry compared to most sports, simply due to the level of equipment required to play even a recreational game,” said Matt Roller, assistant editor at the ESPNCricinfo website. “In my view, that is the principal reason that football has long been a global sport: All you need is a ball and any small space.” But there are other reasons, too, behind cricket’s failure – by and large – to expand beyond its traditional markets, believe some experts. One key factor? The sport’s roots. Jamie Alter, a cricket analyst and journalist, said that cricket’s foundations in colonialism mean the very fabric of the sport is tied to Commonwealth countries. “The game is too intrinsic to the cultures of most of these countries, and despite the efforts of the ICC to expand cricket across the globe, it remains a rather limited sport since it relies on too few countries to properly thrive and expand,” Alter said. Traditionally cricket-loving nations like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh alone constitute a market of nearly two billion people. “Even more insular is the strength of cricket from a commercial perspective,” he added, referring to the economic clout of India and developed cricket-playing countries like England and Australia. That insularity can blunt any sense of urgency to expand the sport’s reach among administrators. Still, it isn’t as though the pool of nations that play cricket has remained entirely stagnant. Though there are records of the British playing cricket in Afghanistan in the 19th century, the sport really took off in the war-torn nation among refugees who played in camps in Pakistan in the past two decades. Then, in its first-ever 50-over World Cup in 2015, the Afghan side beat Scotland. In 2019, the country received test status – the pinnacle of the sport – and soon defeated two other test nations: Bangladesh and fellow greenhorn, Ireland. Afghan players are now regulars in T20 franchise leagues across the world. But there is little to suggest that the sport’s bosses have plans in place to replicate Afghanistan’s success. In fact, some experts believe that administrators are wary of upstart teams upsetting major nations with big markets, especially in events like the World Cup. Cricket World Cups have often attracted criticism over their small pool of participating teams. The World Cups are poorly designed – too long and with too few teams – said Tim Wigmore, deputy cricket correspondent for The Daily Telegraph newspaper. The 10-team World Cup in India will have 48 matches spanning 46 days. The 2022 football World Cup in Qatar had 32 teams and yet ran for less than a month. “Cricket has been incredibly conservative in the number of teams it has allowed in World Cups,” Wigmore, co-author of the book Crickonomics, said. And the reasons are not entirely innocent, according to him. In 2007, the 50-overs World Cup had 16 teams. But Ireland defeated Pakistan and Bangladesh beat India, pushing the South Asian nations out of the competition at the group stage. Wigmore believes the number of participating nations was “perversely” reduced in subsequent tournaments “to ensure that sides from bigger markets had more games”. Like the men’s game, the women’s World Cups also feature very few teams. The first edition of the Women’s World Cup featured seven teams in 1973, and the participation fluctuated over the years, reaching the highest count of 11 in 1997. The latest Women’s World Cup in 2022 featured eight teams and the next edition in 2025 will also have the same count. “So allowing more teams is long overdue – though this year’s ODI World Cup still only has 10 teams and the number in the women’s World Cups is only growing very slowly,” Wigmore said. ODIs – One Day Internationals – are 50-over-a-side matches between international teams. Georgie Heath, a cricket commentator and presenter, said that the World Cups also need to be marketed in the right way to attract new fans. “So much advertising seems to be targeted at those who are already cricket fans and are going to watch or attend games anyway. There needs to be more focus on how they are going to bring in new audiences, players and fans and what the sport offers them,” Heath said. “Often only being on pay-to-view television is a barrier to expansion, too, and this is something that needs to be addressed as well as some of the extortionate prices often charged for tickets.” Achaotic ticketing systemat the World Cup that’s about to begin has frustrated fans. Ticket prices range from 499 rupees ($6) to 40,000 rupees ($481) on BookMyShow, the official ticketing platform. Rates in the resale market are exorbitant, with the most expensive ticket for the highly-anticipated India vs Pakistan match selling for 25 million rupees ($300,545) on Viagogo, a multinational ticket exchange and ticket resale brand. Meanwhile, questions over the very survival of the ODI format are mounting. In July, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) – the custodians of the game’s laws – recommended limiting the number of ODI internationals following the 2027 World Cup. The suggestion comes at a time when the 50-over format is losing its relevance: Longer, five-day test matches remain the priority for traditional fans, while casual viewers have embraced a quicker and glitzier 20-over-a-side format that has spawned multiple franchise leagues. Cricketers themselves are less convinced that it is time to bid farewell to ODIs. Areportin 2022 by the Federation of International Cricketers’ Association, the global body that represents players, said that 54 percent of cricketers still consider the ODI World Cup as the top trophy to compete for, though the number had reduced significantly from 86 percent in their 2018-19 survey. “My view is that one-day cricket will be played less and less at the international level, but that the World Cup will remain a pinnacle event that players aspire to be part of,” Roller said. “The general issue for 50-over cricket is that bilateral international cricket is increasingly being squeezed by franchise leagues – and private investors clearly have limited interest in the idea of 50-over leagues, seeing the speed of games as a key component of short-form cricket’s appeal.” To Roller, the T20 World Cup – held every two years – is a “much clearer vehicle for growth”. With next year’s T20 World Cup set to feature 20 teams, its biggest pool of participants so far, Wigmore, the cricket writer and author, expects the tournament to be a big catalyst for cricket’s growth. But it won’t be easy. Lower-ranked teams are likely to struggle to remain competitive as they receive a very limited share of central broadcast revenue from the T20 World Cup, Roller pointed out, limiting the resources that they can funnel back into popularising the sport. “Staging the tournament every two years also risks killing the golden goose: the scarcity of World Cups in other sports helps add to their prestige,” he added. Other analysts believe the future lies in T20 cricket – not so much in international matches, but in franchise leagues. In 2018, ex-ICC CEO David Richardson said that it was “quite clear” that T20 cricket would be the format by which the governing body could “globalise and grow the game worldwide”. Fast forward to 2023, and the T20 format seems to be flourishing. There are domestic and franchise leagues taking place in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Oceania and some parts of Europe. The Indian Premier League (IPL), which has an estimated brand value of $8.4bn, has built its status as the world’s top T20 competition since its inception in 2008. Lucrative leagues have also started in Australia, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, England and Wales, Pakistan, the Caribbean and most recently in the United States. “T20 cricket has spread the sport, but for cricket to be a sustainable and global game, it’s going to be these leagues that are starting up everywhere, like in the US or UAE,” said Bharat Sundaresan, cricket writer for the Cricbuzz website. “Eventually, we’ll reach a point where if there is a window, new leagues could come up in other nations. “And that’s personally how I see cricket growing even more in a global sense,” Sundaresan said. In July, cricket broke into the world’s wealthiest market, the US, with thelaunch of Major League Cricket, with six teams competing in the T20 format. The MLC assembled an impressive group of investors, with four of its six franchises owned by business entities that also own teams in the IPL. The US – along with the West Indies – is also scheduled to host the T20 World Cup next year, offering an opportunity for the sport and format to grow there. “All these IPL franchise owners, whether they have the best interest of the sport in mind or not, the one thing they do know to do is to run a successful business,” Sundaresan said. “Their business is so dependent on their brand being showcased for a longer period during the year rather than just for two months, which is why they’re buying out all the teams around the world. It’s just going to lead to there being more leagues,” he added. Sundaresan also tipped women’s cricket as playing a key role in enhancing the sport’s global image. The first full-fledged five-team Women’s Premier League (WPL) earlier this year saw several female cricketers witnessing the biggest payday of their careers at the auction. Meanwhile, the FairBreak Invitational T20 held its second edition in Hong Kong this year, featuring some of the world’s best female cricketers who took part in the six-team tournament. “I think women’s cricket will popularise cricket as a sport more globally than what men’s cricket has been able to do in the last 150 years,” Sundaresan said. He cited the stunning emergence of Thailand – a country with no known history in the sport – as a petri dish of talent in the women’s game. They qualified for their first global event in 2020 when they competed at the Women’s T20 World Cup and the team has been ranked as high as 10th internationally. Thai players have also grabbed attention in franchise leagues. In 2020, opening batter Natthakan Chantham played for the Trailblazers in the Women’s T20 Challenge competition in India, becoming the first Thai cricketer to play in a professional T20 franchise league. All-rounders Nattaya Boochatham and Sornnarin Tippoch, as well as batter Naruemol Chaiwai, featured in the FairBreak Invitational T20 this year. “Suddenly, it’s a free-for-all, right?” Sundaresan said. “Like, you can be part of a national team in a country which doesn’t have a great standard of cricket, but you have a tournament to go to and play.” The T20 format is also firing bigger ambitions for cricket. The sport’s authorities have bid for cricket to be included in the Los Angeles Olympic Games in 2028, having last featured at the 1900 Games in Paris. The proposal: A five-team T20 competition, for both men and women. But will cricket as an Olympic sport help expand its global reach? Not everyone is sure. “I’d love to see cricket played at the Olympics for the second time especially as this will then include women playing cricket, too,” Heath, the commentator and presenter, said. “My reservations here lie in considering how many countries will be included, what the qualification routes are, who plays, and the danger that it just becomes another tournament of the same countries playing out as we always see.” Other experts agree that while Olympic involvement could give cricket more global visibility, it is unlikely to transform its footprint overnight. “A small T20 tournament might not be transformative in itself and would likely be played by only a few teams in the first instance,” Roller said. An Olympic stamp in itself wouldn’t mean that cricket has gone global, Roller said. “There are a number of relatively niche sports at the Olympics already, which are much smaller than cricket in terms of participation numbers or audience.” Indeed, some analysts wonder whether cricket even needs to aspire for a presence in every part of the world. “I love cricket and always will, but I don’t see how it going to the Olympics is going to really promote the sport,” Alter said. “Does cricket need to be a global sport? It’s successful for over 150 years in its own world.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

So far, it seems that the establishment sees Sharif as a much-needed alternative to the dangerous populism of Imran Khan. Sharif’s return makes it easier to hold elections that he might win. But history does not give reason for optimism about him being able to complete his tenure, if elected, and having a free hand in policymaking. He has previously been elected prime minister thrice, only to be removed from office each time without completing his term. In 1993, he was removed from office by a Presidential decree. In 1999, he was toppled in a military coup. And in 2017, he was disqualified from being prime minister by judicial fiat. He has retained a strong support base, especially in the military’s dominant recruiting region of Punjab, throughout the last three decades. But he has not seen eye to eye with successive army chiefs, several of whom were appointed by Sharif. The usual point of contention has been differences over security and foreign policies and over the military leaders’ right to determine policies. The question now is, will a fourth Sharif term conclude without a fatal altercation with Pakistan’s military leaders. On the eve of the July 2018 elections that broughtImran Khanto office, I had predicted the return of Sharif in the not-too-distant future. “Even if the military succeeds in installing a selected prime minister into office after the votes are cast,” I wrote, “it will not succeed in its core objective of creating a credible, effective, civilian façade. Sharif’s imprisonment will not end his (or his daughter’s) political careers long after the retirement of the generals and colonels who plotted his downfall.” That is exactly what happened. The generals’ choice, Imran Khan, became a greater threat to the almighty establishment than any other politician had ever been. After he was removed from office, the former cricketer went on a rampage that threatened Pakistan’s external relations as well as domestic order. Enraged by his arrest, Khan’s cult of fans attacked military installations — something even declared enemies of the Pakistani state had not done. Unlike Sharif, and Benazir Bhutto before him, Imran Khan was not a politician locking horns with the military over civilian supremacy under the constitution. He was trying to prove that his popularity was greater than public approval for Pakistan’s military leaders and that he was stronger than the permanent state apparatus. The military responded with a crackdown, supported by most political elites, but given its unwillingness to impose military rule, it also needed a popular political alternative. Sharif’s return, and the fast-track reversal of criminal charges and cases against him, is the result of the establishment’s desire to hold an election that Khan does not win. From the establishment’s perspective, Sharif would be a safer pair of hands than the narcissistic cricketer-turned-politician, given Sharif’s experience in both winning elections and governance. But the establishment’s willingness to let Sharif have another turn is a reflection of some difficult ground realities. At the time Sharif was forced into exile, Pakistani Punjab was divided between Sharif’s anti-establishment followers, who believed that fighting the establishment to secure democracy was more important than fighting corruption, and Imran Khan’s pro-establishment supporters who repeated what had been the mantra of every Pakistani coup-maker: Pakistan’s politicians are a threat to the country; corruption must be eliminated before democracy can function; and generals and judges know what is in the country’s interest better than the illiterate peasants, workers, and the unemployed. Now, Khan’s supporters have also turned against the establishment, albeit for different reasons. That necessitates a cooling-off period during which critical policy issues, such as managing the economy and reorienting Pakistan’s rather stagnant foreign policy can be tackled through cooperation between traditional politicians and the establishment. Khan and his fans can be wished away no more than Sharif and his supporters could be six years ago. But the Pakistani establishment, and Sharif, both seem to have decided to deal with that matter at a later stage. Like all Pakistani politicians, Sharif has made compromises in his long career and has sometimes taken contrary public positions for short-term popularity. But he is identified, by and large, with an emphasis on economic progress and peaceful relations with Pakistan’s neighbours, including India. His views on economic liberalisation and normalisation with India have also been the major reason for his past conflicts with the establishment. The timing of Sharif’s return is ominous. At a time when its economy is in shambles, Pakistan also confronts multiple external challenges. Relations with India are as strained as ever. Hopes that the Taliban’s control of Afghanistan will end threats to Pakistan from its northwestern border have proved futile. Pakistan now faces an increasing threat from local extremists and terrorists. Moreover, Pakistan is no longer able to obtain military and economic assistance from the United States by highlighting support for America’s global objectives; its close partnership with China is yielding fewer economic benefits than Pakistani leaders expected; and Pakistan’s traditional friends in the Arab world have expanded their economic ties with India and want Pakistan to also straighten out its economy and end Islamist militancy. If, as is rumoured, Pakistan’s current military leadership itself wants respite from endless conflict to focus on the economy, Sharif might be able to try and re-engage with India. But while focusing on the economy and implementing his vision of ‘‘liberalisation, de-regulation, privatisation” might be feasible, building a new relationship with India might be more difficult. Sharif recognised as much by talking in his homecoming speech about both “ending conflict with neighbours” and “seeking an honourable solution to the Kashmir dispute”. Still, Sharif has tried before and will probably try again to improve ties with India, this time with the generals’ acquiescence. But before that he must win another election.

Makers ofKhichdi 2on Wednesday dropped the trailer of their comedy film, which stars Supriya Pathak, Jamnadas Majethia, Rajeev Mehta, Anang Desai and Vandana Pathak. The movie is a direct sequel to the 2010 film Khichdi: The Movie. Apart from the franchise regulars, the sequel will also see cameos by Kirti Kulhari, Farah Khan Kunder, Pratik Gandhi, Anant Vidhaat, Paresh Ganatra, Kiku Sharda, Flora Saini and Reyaansh Veer Chaddha. The over two-minute long trailer begins with establishing its no-brainer world: that after the birth of Pakistan and India on August 14 and 15th, respectively, a new kingdom came into existence – Paanthukisatn. What follows next is a series of adventures, misadventures, outlandish scenarios and gangs. Sample this, when Rajeev Mehta’s Praful asks Pratik Gandhi, playing a pilot, “Who are you?”, the Scam 1992 actor asks sarcastically,“Aapko kya lagta hai?”In his trademark quirk, Praful says,“Mujhe joota lagta hai, log mujhe marte hai tab.”The line leads Hansa, played always to adorable perfection by Supriya Pathak, to gloat that last year Praful was hit by Qutub Minar. A puzzled Pratik asks how is it even possible to throw Qutub Minar at someone, only to be told,“Ha, par jijaji ko toh phek sakte hai na Qutub Minar pe?” Khichdi first aired as a weekly sitcom in 2002 on Star Plus and soon emerged as one of the most loved shows on TV, thanks to its humour, memorable characters and performances. After two seasons on TV, the franchise eventually transitioned to films in 2010 when it released its first installment. Khichdi 2 is now gearing to release on November 17, a week afterSalman Khan’s Tiger 3. Khichdi 2 is written and directed by Aatish Kapadia, and produced by Jamnadas Majethia.

All 10 participating teams have named their 15-member squads for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023, which will be played in India from October 5 to November 19. Some teams have depended on experience to land them cricket’s most coveted trophy, while others have put their faith in a mix of old and new faces. Only a few of these will end up being standout performers for their team’s campaign on the biggest stage in cricket. Here are the top 10 names you should watch out for at this year’s tournament: Pakistan’s captain and most prolific run scorer in recent years is an obvious choice given his reign at the top of the ICC men’s one-day international (ODI) rankings. Babar has been consistently ranked among the top five batters in the format over the past six years. Although the 28-year-old had a mediocre run at the recently-concluded Asia Cup by his standards (207 runs in four innings) and could not lead his team into the final, Pakistan’s chances of qualifying for the semifinals of the World Cup will be closely linked to his batting form and on-field decisions. Azam has garnered praise from several former greats, including Pakistan’s only Cricket World Cup-winning captain and former Prime Minister Imran Khan who termed him a “complete” batter. “His technique, talent and temperament are all brilliant. It is very rare to find all three of these things in one batsman, but he has them all,” Khan said in an interview earlier this year. Babar Azam receives a welcome as loud and as raucous as every cheer Hyderabad’s own David Warner has received all evening. Great to see class being acknowledged & appreciated regardless of where you’re playing#CWC23 — Bharat Sundaresan (@beastieboy07)October 3, 2023  Arguably the biggest star in world cricket and one of India’s all-time great cricketers, Virat Kohli has nearly all major titles in international cricket. Despite his age, the 34-year-old is among the fittest athletes in the sport and continues to score runs with a scarcely believable consistency. Kohli has scored three centuries this year and now stands one short of Indian great Sachin Tendulkar’s record of 49 ODI hundreds. The former India captain, who was part of India’s World Cup-winning side in 2011, has pledged to bring another title to the cricket-mad country. “The memories of past World Cup victories, especially the iconic 2011 win, are etched in our hearts, and we want to create new memories for our fans,” Kohli said in the lead-up to the tournament. The Afghan leg-spinner has established himself as the country’s first globally recognised cricket icon. Khan made his debut at 17 years in 2015, and has since gone on to take 336 wickets across all formats of the game. Khan’s bewildering googlies and relentless ability to take wickets have made him a mainstay of Afghanistan’s team over the past eight years. The 25-year-old’s ODI batting average of nearly 20 comes at a high strike rate and ability to push his side towards big totals with his contributions lower down the order. Afghanistan will look at their former (youngest) captain to help them pose a challenge for the semifinal spots. Just when you think it is one of those rare days when you have the measure of@rashidkhan_19he reminds you why he is the greatest. — Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha)April 9, 2023  When Australia take the field on traditionally spin-friendly Indian pitches, Zampa will be their only specialist leg-spinner in the squad. The 31-year-old has established a reputation for breaking opposition partnerships and providing crucial breakthroughs for his team. The combination of his healthy strike rate (31.5) and tight economy rate (5.53) will make him Australia’s most important bowler in the 50-over format, where he has taken 45 wickets in the past 20 months. In a squad brimming with power hitters, Klaasen stands out for the ability to walk on to the crease lower down the order and get down to the business of hitting boundaries right away. He boasts one of the highest strike rates among current batters as he often scores most of his runs from fours and sixes. As a skilled wicketkeeper, the 32-year-old holds the record for 10 wicketkeeping dismissals and scoring 200 runs in a series. Last month, the power-hitter scored an 83-ball-174 against Australia in a home ODI series and South Africa will hope that Klaasen brings his recent form on to the biggest stage. Heinrich Klaasen will be the batter to watch in the World Cup… he plays spin well … has experience of Indian pitches  through IPL… watch out ! — Shahid Hashmi (@hashmi_shahid)September 15, 2023  Stokes is arguably England’s biggest player of the current generation and their standout performer during their 2019 triumph. Following a brief retirement from the format, the 32-year-old made a return to ODI cricket and was included in England’s squad last month. Stokes marked his return with a 124-ball-184 in the recent ODI series against New Zealand, breaking Jason Roy’s record (180) for the highest individual score in an ODI for England and guiding his team to an 181-run win. The all-rounder has been playing as a specialist batter in recent months but his impressive fielding and contribution to on-field decision-making will be invaluable to captain Jos Buttler. What is more, India’s Kohli recently picked Stokes as his current favourite cricketer. Shakib Al Hasan is perhaps Bangladesh’s greatest cricketer of all time and one of the world’s all-time great all-rounders. The wily left-arm spinner and left-handed batter has reigned over the ICC ODI all-rounder rankings for nearly 14 years. He has also consistently been among the best bowlers and all-rounders in other formats of the game. The 36-year-old has astounding statistics in ODI cricket alone, with 308 wickets and 7,384 runs to go with several individual records that he has accumulated over his 17-year career. Despite his individual brilliance, the Bangladesh captain has not been able to lead his team to glory in a major ICC tournament. But his fans will hope that can change this time around. Just as Pakistan captain Azam’s form could be the deciding factor in Pakistan’s run at the tournament, fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi’s spells with the ball will be key to their chances of hunting down batters on high-scoring Indian pitches. Since making his international debut as an 18-year-old in 2018, Afridi has swiftly taken over as Pakistan’s bowling spearhead and has often found a place at the top of the ICC bowlers’ rankings. The left-arm pacer has a penchant for taking wickets in his first over and handing his team an early advantage. With right-arm fast bowler Naseem Shah out injured, Afridi’s importance as an opening bowler will be doubled, but the pacer has shown his capability of handling big-match pressure in previous tournaments. The all-rounder has quietly established himself as a mainstay of the New Zealand side. The 32-year-old has been his captain Kane Williamson’s go-to bowler in tough situations, including a crucial spell in their semifinal win over India in the 2019 Cricket World Cup.

He comes from the Lasith Malinga school of slingy round-arm fast-bowling action and has a habit of keeping opposition scoring rates in check. The 20-year-old combines unplayable yorkers with dreadful bouncers and has made an instant impact in international cricket. Pathirana finished last month’s Asia Cup as the leading wicket-taker and impressed many former and current cricketers.

Twice in the space of 24 hours this month, cricket took strides towards becoming a truly global sport, and it was fitting that both developments took place in India, the main driving force in the game. In New Delhi on October 15, Afghanistan recorded one of thebiggest shocksin cricket history by defeating defending champions England at the Cricket World Cup. The next day in Mumbai, something less surprising but more seismic happened: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced thatcricket would be includedin the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Cricket last appeared at an Olympics in 1900. The Los Angeles Games are likely to feature six teams – for both men and women – playing the T20 version of the game. While the cricketing superpower India had pushed for the inclusion, smaller countries hope it can be a game changer for a sport that has for decades been almost the sole preserve of England and seven territories that were formerly part of the British Empire: Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies. Afghanistan only became a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2017, taking the total to 12. The remaining three members are Bangladesh, the Netherlands and Ireland – countries that rarely get a chance to play the established powers. “During my time as the head of the Afghan Cricket Board [ACB], my argument at the ICC level was clear – we needed more opportunities to play against the big teams,” Shafiq Stanikzai, former CEO of the ACB, told Al Jazeera. “Beating England is a testament to our belief that the more we play, the better we get.”      Whether India wins the Cricket World Cup it is currently hosting, the country off the field is thedriving force in the sportdue to its cricket-crazy population of 1.4 billion and its cricketingfinancial clout. TheIndian Premier League, a T20 competition that began on a franchise basis in 2008, is one of the most lucrative sporting competitions in the world. A five-year broadcast deal was done in 2022 for $6bn, and it attracts most of the best players. In terms of viewers, cricket is the second most watched sport in the world after football, and much of this audience comes from the subcontinent. When India and Pakistan met in England at the 2019 World Cup,273 million peopletuned in to watch. Such numbers are why the IOC is interested in India because the organisation’s revenue mostly comes from broadcast rights and sponsorship deals. “The country is one of sport’s next great frontiers,” Simon Chadwick, professor of political economy and sport at Skema Business School in Paris, told Al Jazeera. According to the United Kingdom’sDaily Telegraphnewspaper, Los Angeles 2028 broadcast rights from Asia alone are estimated to be worth more than $250m on the back of cricket’s inclusion. For the IOC, which faces a threat posed by illegal streaming, these are significant figures. “For cricket lovers and Indians in general, it is a huge thing that India’s favourite sport will be represented in the Olympics,” Arunava Chadhuri, a consultant who specialises in Indian sport, told Al Jazeera. In the past, India’s cricket board was wary about cricket being an Olympic sport, worrying that it would place too many demands on already overworked players and lead to other lucrative games and tournaments being cancelled. With India announcing itsbid to host the 2036 Olympics, attitudes have changed, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his delight with cricket’s inclusion in 2028. “As a cricket-loving nation, we specially welcome inclusion of cricket, reflecting the rising global popularity of this wonderful sport,” he wrote on social media. Absolutely delighted that baseball-softball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse and squash will feature in@LA28. This is great news for sportspersons. As a cricket loving nation, we specially welcome inclusion of cricket, reflecting the rising global popularity of this wonderful…https://t.co/tnwrzqVPfL — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)October 16, 2023   Smaller nations have more modest ambitions for cricket’s inclusion at Los Angeles 2028 because it can take the game to the next level commercially. With space for just six nations in Los Angeles, it is likely that the established powers will take the spots initially, but in many countries, Olympic inclusion brings with it much needed state funding and private investment. Better facilities, coaching and investment at the grassroots level could lift the level of the smaller nations. “It will attract all manner of inward investment into the sport, from new broadcasting contracts and sponsors to new generations of fans and investors,” Stanikzai said. “There is a real opportunity for smaller nations to take advantage of the inevitable commercial and financial windfalls. “It means more opportunities at the global level and a great chance for associate nations to showcase their talent on a grand stage, resulting in increased funding and broader participation for all cricket boards.” An increased profile and revenues could also help spread the game to new outposts around the planet – at least the shorter versions of it. Chadwick pointed to the relatively recent addition of the T20 format, in which each team gets 20 overs of six balls each in a contest that usually lasts for no more than three hours, which he said shows that cricket can adapt to modern demands and can fit into an event like the Olympics and appeal to broadcasters. “Cricket has consistently proved how new, innovative formats can engage audiences and drive content creation and sharing,” Chadwick said.      Brazil, a football-crazy nation, is hoping to make its mark in cricket and is especially ambitious in the female form of the game, in which there is a national league and a national team that made its international debut in 2007. “Cricket now being an Olympic sport helps the development in two ways,” Roberta Moretti Avery, captain of Brazil women’s national team, told Al Jazeera. “Firstly, through access to Olympic sports funding through the National Olympic Committee for grassroots, development of structures and high-performance funding. And secondly, it will become more accessible for Brazilians as we will have cricket on television. Brazilian commentators – and Brazilians – love the Olympics.” The game is also growing in the United States, driven by an Indian community of almost five million people. In July, the first everMajor League Cricketseason took place, featuring six teams and an average attendance of close to 4,000, and Los Angeles could help take the game to the next level. In China too, there is a small but passionate hardcore base who play the game, and with the Olympics on the horizon, it will now get access to state funding. This could be a game changer for other nations too. For Chadwick, this means that the pressure is now on cricket to show that it can become truly global. “It’s now a case of converting theory into reality as cricket needs to stimulate participation, draw audiences and attract partners and then sustain its commercial performance,” he said. “Inclusion in the Olympics is as much a challenge to improve and develop as it is an opportunity.”          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

They worry that the rights and freedoms won by the Solidarity movement over three decades ago are at risk, as the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, or PiS, campaigns to secure a record third term in office. ""It's a very important election. We're deciding whether we're going back to being a democratic country,"" was student activist Julia Landowska's stark take on this weekend's vote. ""This is our last call, to go to the election and fight for a better future in Poland."" The event she helped organise was held under the slogan In My Day, Things Will Be Better. A mixture of discussions and live music topped off with a silent disco, it was designed to encourage reluctant younger voters to the polls. The activist's worries are echoed by others in Gdansk, who point to the shrinking independence of the courts under a PiS government and backsliding on women's rights, including a near-total ban on abortion.  There is also concern about media freedom - publicly funded TV becoming a government mouthpiece - as well as acrimonious wrangling with Brussels on issues from judicial reform to migration. That is why many Poles are now hailing the election on 15 October as the most important since 1989, when Solidarity candidates swept the board in the first partially-free vote since communist rule.  The story of Poland's struggle for freedom dominates the northern port city of Gdansk. There is a Solidarity museum in the shipyard once occupied by strikers and billboards through the city centre that recount the momentous changes brought by their protest, led by an electrician named Lech Walesa. This year, his son is running for re-election. ""We have to make sure we win, to reform all that has been destroyed in eight years,"" Jaroslaw Walesa explained, referring to the two terms PiS have held office so far. Representing the opposition Civil Coalition, like fellow Gdansk-native and party leader Donald Tusk, he is most worried by Poland's increasingly antagonistic relations with the EU. Like Brussels, he is also concerned about the politicisation of Polish courts. ""If you look at what has been done to our democracy, we took a huge step backwards. That's definitely not what my father fought for,"" Mr Walesa told the BBC this week, wandering the paths of the handsome Oliwki park, greeting voters with leaflets and a promise of change. The 1989 slogan - Don't sleep, or they'll outvote you! - has been resurrected in Gdansk for this election, all part of pitching it as another critical moment for Polish democracy. The city is expected to vote solidly for the opposition, as usual. But opinion polls put the governing Law and Justice Party ahead nationwide, although probably without a big enough majority to form a government. So the last-minute battle for votes is intense. In the town of Elblag, a short drive from Gdansk, campaigners spent Saturday canvassing for the governing party at a food market.  Between piles of potatoes and giant pumpkins, they dished out bags printed with the PiS logo and leaflets promoting the city's main candidate, who didn't show up. ""PiS have a good programme for us young people and for my children. I have twins and they've got a good programme for our future,"" party activist Monica explained, referring to the 500 zloty (£95) monthly child benefit the government now pays. It is set to rise to 800 next year if PiS win. ""In Poland, this amount can solve many things,"" her husband added.  Neither accepted the opposition's fears for the future of democracy in Poland. ""Democracy is good for us,"" Monica said - and she wants to stay in the EU. The pair both talked about security, including the government's slogan that it is ""protecting the future of Poles"".  ""We're not ready to accept immigrants. Muslims,"" Monica clarified, adding that Poland had already taken in ""a lot of Ukrainians"", meaning those who came in 2022 as refugees.  The Russian exclave of Kaliningrad is nearby and there is a new barbed-wire fence along its entire length.  The activists' pro-government message was not universally welcomed by marketgoers, even though the Elblag regional vote was strongly pro-PiS at the last election. Several shoppers thrust the free bags back when they realised which party logo was printed on them. Others retorted that PiS had been so good for Poland that their children had moved abroad for better opportunities. In such a polarised race, much of the campaigning has been nasty.  In this week's testy election debate on state TV, Donald Tusk again referred to the government as ""evil"" and called the prime minister Pinocchio. PM Mateusz Morawiecki shrugged him, and others, off as a ""band of redheads"", in reference to Mr Tusk's hair. His party consistently claims that the Civic Coalition represents ""foreign interests"", painting Donald Tusk as a traitor and a stooge of Berlin.  Such talk is particularly worrying in Gdansk. Piotr Adamowicz tells me he gets heckled at election events, usually by elderly voters who yell that he is ""German"" and should ""speak Polish"".  ""The current campaign is very aggressive, from the tongues of politicians and state media, and it is very dangerous,"" the Civic Coalition candidate says. It is a statement he does not make lightly: his brother, Pawel, the former mayor of Gdansk, was fatally stabbed on stage in 2019. The murderer, who was jailed for life this year, falsely claimed at the time of the attack that ""Civic Platform tortured me"". ""The disgusting politics and hate speech [we see now] hurts and worries me because such a tragedy could happen again,"" Piotr Adamowicz warns. He says he regularly gets anonymous death threats including promises to ""stab you like your brother"". Back in the shadow of the giant cranes at the old Lenin shipyard, young people posed in front of a sign declaring how they want to improve their country. ""We're really worried. That's why we came: so we can change something,"" first-year psychology student Julia explained.  She pointed to the near ban on abortion that sparked giant protests in 2020 as one of her big concerns. ""If the governing party wins, I will maybe just leave the country, it's that bad!"" added Sophia, a gay woman distressed by the introduction of ""LGBT-free zones"" some years ago, several of which remain in place. ""They hate me! I'm scared."" Both 20-year-olds were shocked by the rhetoric at this, their first ever election. ""Everyone is fuming and it's kind of scary!"" Sophia said.  Two years ago, event organiser Julia Landowska was fined for swearing about PiS at a protest, a charge she is currently appealing.  She believes her case was meant to frighten others and silence dissent. So as PiS supporters are encouraged to the polls by talk of more security and more social spending, Julia plans to cast her own vote for change - less momentous than in 1989, but important.

At least 57 people were killed in two attacks at Pakistani mosques just last week. One of the bombers was identified as an Afghan national, Bugti said. The TTP has denied responsibility for the blasts. At least 1,000 Afghans have been detained by the Pakistani authorities over the past two weeks, according to the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad. An estimated 4.4 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan, including 600,000 that came since August 2021, when the US-backed government in Kabul surrendered to the Taliban. As of November 1, Pakistan will also require valid passports and visas from any Afghans wishing to enter the country, Bugti added. They were previously allowed in with just a national ID card. While Bugti’s announcement applied specifically to“illegal residents”of Pakistan, state news agency APP quoted an anonymous government official who said that their expulsion would be just the first phase. Everyone with Afghan citizenship would be expelled in phase two, and phase three would apply even to individuals with valid residence permits, according to the APP source. Pakistan began accepting refugees during the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-89). The flow of refugees continued during the civil war in 1990s and the subsequent US-led occupation of Afghanistan (2001-21)."

Set to stream worldwide from October 5, the film is based on the novel ‘Escape To Nowhere’, written by Amar Bhushan, the former chief of counter espionage at India’s foreign intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). Tabu plays Krishna Mehra, a RAW operative grappling with her dual identity as a spy and a lover when assigned to investigate a colleague who appears to have leaked information that led to the death of her girlfriend in Bangladesh. Fazal plays the colleague, an agent with complex motives for his disloyalty, while Gabbi plays his wife, an unwitting accomplice who is placed under close surveillance by RAW operatives in Delhi.Related StoriesRatings'Loki' Takes No. 6 Among Nielsen Streaming Originals With Season 2 Debut; 'Grey's Anatomy' Sees ResurgenceInterviews'All The Light We Cannot See' Director/EP Shawn Levy On Striving For Authenticity From Casting A Blind Lead To Shooting In Saint-Malo For Netflix Adaptation Bhardwaj also co-wrote the script with Rohan Narula, a NYU Tisch graduate with whom he’s co-written three features, and produced through his Vishal Bhardwaj Films banner. Ashish Vidyarthi and Azmeri Haque Badhon also star. Bhushan’s novel is meant to be fiction but is clearly based on some of the real-life cases he encountered while working at RAW. Bhardwaj says he optioned the book years ago, but as he had so many other projects on the go, put it in a drawer. “It wasn’t the easiest read, because Bhushan is not a fiction writer, but he went into an amazing amount of detail about secret missions and operations that nobody else had ever dared to write,” Bhardwaj says. He didn’t revisit the book until late actor Irrfan Khan brought it to his attention some years before his death. “Irrfan said he’d met the writer and was very keen to play the protagonist,” Bhardwaj remembers. “So I renewed the rights and wrote it for Irrfan. But then he fell sick. I met him once when he was going for treatment, and he said, ‘please don’t make the film with anyone else, you have to make it with me’.” Khan died of cancer in 2020 at the age of 53. Bhardwaj was so distressed that he felt the only way he could make the film was to change the protagonist role completely. So he rewrote the role for a woman and cast Tabu, an award-winning actress he’s worked with in two of his Shakespeare adaptations,MaqboolandHaider. Like Khan, with whom she’d starred in Mira Nair’sThe Namesake, Tabu is well known to international audiences, also through credits includingLife Of Piand Nair’s BBC seriesA Suitable Boy. The film marks the first time Bhardwaj has made a spy thriller, but he describes it as being more of a drama than a thriller, as it focuses on the characters’ deep-rooted emotional conflicts, which is something he’s become known for through his Shakespeare adaptations as well as films such asKamineyandSeven Sins Forgiven(7 Khoon Maaf). “I’d say it’s more of a character study of a woman than an action film, but if I had to make comparisons I’d say the closest reference isThe Lives Of Others,” Bhardwaj says. “It’s also very different to the kind of roles that Tabu has played before.” Bhushan says the in-depth accounts of close surveillance were another factor he found interesting in the novel (in one amusing but uncomfortable scene, the spies turn away when the agent’s wife starts doing a striptease while miming to a Bollywood classic) as well as the complex motives various countries have for their allegiances and betrayals. U.S. intelligence agencies do not come across as heroes in the film. The agent under surveillance, played by Fazal, eventually flees to South Dakota under the protection of the CIA, which is in league with Pakistan and Bangladesh, against India’s interests. “Bhushan had spent a lot of time in Bangladesh, a country that was being used for different reasons by both the U.S. and India, as well as having this complicated relationship with Pakistan,” Bhardwaj explains. But he says he also brought in romantic and personal angles that were not in the book, “because otherwise the story would have been too dry.” Krishna, the agent played by Tabu, does not have an issue with her sexuality, but she’s not completely open about it either, adding to the themes of identity and the complex decisions behind what we choose to reveal about ourselves or keep concealed from others. “Khufiya means secret in Urdu, so there’s this layer of meaning in that she accepts her identity, but she’s keeping it a secret from her son,” Bhardwaj says. Khufiyawas filmed in India and Canada, with Delhi standing in for the scenes in Bangladesh, and Calgary standing in for South Dakota. One of the busiest filmmakers in India’s current OTT boom, Bhardwaj also recently wrote, directed and produced six-part seriesCharlie Chopra And The Mystery Of Solang Valley, an adaptation of Agatha Christie’s ‘The Sittaford Mystery’, for SonyLiv. WhileKhufiyadebuts on Netflix worldwide from October 5, the film will also receive its theatrical world premiere next week as the opening film of the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles (October 11-15)."

Russia’s military has conducted a “massive” retaliatory nuclear strike drill, hours after the upper house of parliament voted torevokethe country’s ratification of a global ban on nuclear testing. The exercise, which involved the test launch of missiles from a land-based silo, a nuclear submarine and from long-range bomber aircraft, was overseen by President Vladimir Putin. Russian state television showed Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and armed forces chief Valery Gerasimov briefing Putin by video link. “Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief,” Shoigu said, addressing the president. He said the purpose of the drills was to practise “dealing a massive nuclear strike with strategic offensive forces in response to a nuclear strike by the enemy”. The drill comes 20 months since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and with Putin and Russian officials giving mixed signals about the possible use of nuclear weapons. Russia, which has the world’s largest nuclear arsenal, has moved quickly in recent weeks to revoke its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in a move Moscow says is necessary to bring it into line with the United States, which has signed but never ratified the treaty. Wednesday’s unanimous passage of the bill through the upper house means it now needs only Putin’s signature to take effect. TheCTBToutlaws all nuclear explosions including live tests of nuclear weapons. In addition to the US, it is also yet to be ratified by China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel, Iran and Egypt. In a statement, the Kremlin said a Yars intercontinental ballistic missile was fired from a test site at a target in Russia’s far east, a nuclear-powered submarine launched a ballistic missile from the Barents Sea, and Tu-95MS long-range bombers test-fired air-launched cruise missiles. “The tasks planned in the course of the training exercise were fully accomplished,” it said. Video footage of the exercise published by the Russian Ministry of Defence showed the land and submarine-based missiles streaking into the night sky and nuclear-capable bomber aircraft taking off from an airfield under the cover of darkness. Russia carries out such exercises to test its so-called nuclear triad from time to time. The US also carries out regular nuclear drills. There are concerns that Russia could move to resume nuclear tests to try to discourage the West from continuing to offer military support to Ukraine. Many Russian hawks have spoken in favour of a resumption of the tests. Putin said earlier this month he was “not ready to say” whether Russia needed to carry out live nuclear tests. He has repeatedly invoked Russia’s nuclear doctrine since the start of the Ukraine war, saying last year he was “not bluffing” about his readiness to use destructive weapons should Russia face an existential threat. He has also senttactical nuclear arms to Belarus, a key ally on the border with Ukraine. Tactical nuclear arms are battlefield weapons that, while devastating, have a smaller yield compared to long-range strategic weapons.          Follow Al Jazeera English:"

On a cursory glance around the place, one wonders if he’s right before a security person adds context: most of the young ones who do watch it with passion are busy preparing for their upcoming exams. Back at the shop, the priest’s voice transitions to that of deeper concern while recollecting his spiritual leader’s connection with the sport. “Earlier he used to watch. Now, bad knee,” he says of the 14th Dalai Lama, who has been one of the frequent visitors at cricket in Dharamsala since the early IPL days but is now facing health issues. Situated some eight kms above the HPCA Stadium, the monastery in Mcleod Ganj has been a big tourist attraction. Outside on a gray wall, a freshly painted text in green, yellow and red carves out a picture. “Tibet is my country, my people, my political history.” Tenzin Geche, who works at the Monastery office, tells this paper: “I was maybe four when my family came here. My father, who’s passed away, was in the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) before he came to Tibet and met my mother. He brought us all back here but my mother’s parents still live there.” Geche speaks of the different influences among the Tibetans here. “By culture, we’re Tibetan. But there’s a very deep influence. The young ones want to listen to Bollywood songs,” he says. How can cricket be far behind? For Passang, who works at Serkong House – a centre for the preservation of Tibetan arts and culture in Dharamsala – and has lived all his life in India, the bat-and-ball sport is a passion. “I have been into it since my childhood. I used to play it in our locality inChandigarh, Sector 22,” says the 57-year-old, who’s been to two of the three World Cup games at the HPCA Stadium. Support for the home team As the Indian bowlers start to make inroads into the Bangladesh innings, Passang starts looking ahead. “Now I think we need to beat New Zealand. South Africa, England, inse darr nahi hai. Pakistan se bhi nahi hai (South Africa and England shouldn’t concern us, neither should Pakistan). New Zealand will be tough,” he claims.  His father, who’d moved from Tibet in the late 50s, had little to do with Passang’s sporting obsession. He lets us in on the man responsible, “First, I watched Kapil Dev. I loved his bowling action. We used to watch him on the black-and-white TV and whenever he used to bowl, there was a halla (noise) from the beginning. Almost like everyone knew he’d take a wicket.” There is another memory, from 1984, of having watched an India-England match in Chandigarh. “Back then, the stadium wasn’t in Mohali, it was in Sector 16. I watched Kapil Dev, Yograj Singh – this was 83-84. Also, Allan Lamb,” Passang recalls before the conversation veers back to cricket in Dharamsala. Do the young Tibetans, who grow up in the hill city, also have as strong a bond with the sport as he had with his early years in Punjab? “In Namgyal, the younger monks play it. I remember there was a tournament in Chandigarh some 10-15 years ago where one of the monastery teams from here won the entire thing. They had monks fromShimla, Dehradun and a couple of other places.” Tenzin Phuntshok, who is among those at Namgyal preparing for upcoming exams, holds football above cricket. An ardent Indian national team fan, he shares his agony of having watched the men’s team go down 5-1 against China at the recent Asian Games. “I didn’t think they would beat China three or four nil but I thought they would give them tough competition, like a draw. A miracle might happen. 1-0, I was hoping for that,” he says with a wry smile."

Nitin Sharma, assistant editor, won the award for the report, ‘Don’t wear shorts they told her… this gold medal will inspire all girls’. The report details the struggles of Zareen in her pursuit of the world title – from taunts by relatives and friends to getting injured in the boxing ring to her mother worrying about her marriage. Divya Goyal, principal correspondent, won the award for the report,‘Riding a boat across Sutlej, two girls from Punjab border village make it to high school’. The report detailed the everyday lives of two young girls from Kaluwala village in Ferozepur district, situated on the India-Pakistan border, who pull a boat every day due to lack of a bridge to reach their school. The National Human Rights Commission took suo motu cognizance of the report and issued a notice to the Punjab government. This was followed by a visit of the Punjab education minister to the spot. The minister announced a bridge, which awaits the Centre’s approval. Rupsa Chakraborty, special correspondent, won the award in the ‘investigative category’ for her report titled‘’Death during childbirth at Mumbai’s M-East maternal health takes a beating’, which delved into the issue of high maternal mortality rates inMumbai’s M-East ward that stands lowest in the human development index. The reporter gathered data of six years that outlined alarming maternal deaths in slums that were going unreported. The data highlighted the disparity in healthcare facilities between M-East and other wards.

The defending champions have two points from four matches, similar to their opponents, and are ninth on the table. A win here will not push them too far ahead on the chart, but it may give them that tiny bit of motivation against teams like India and Australia ahead. But a defeat against Lanka will take away even the benevolence of mathematics, which is currently scaffolding their hopes. To avoid being in the proximity of an early exit, England need improvement through the order, and in particular their batters need to fire. For that, they will not get a more favourable venue than the M Chinnaswamy Stadium with its short boundaries and pitch aiding runs. If England lacked clarity on several fronts, Sri Lanka are giving them a close run. Sample this. They brought in veteran Angelo Mathews as Pathirana’s replacement when they had a like-for-like pacer in Dushamantha Chameera available among the travelling reserves. It looks like a serious brain fade as Sri Lanka’s main headache is their stingless bowling. They have conceded 428 against SA, 345 against Pakistan and 215 in 35.2 overs against Australia.

Every weekday from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, we'll spotlight the music of a different Latin American country with a curated playlist of essential tracks, fresh voices and wild cards. The origin of one of Latin America's greatest musical exports is still contested to this day, but Panama has a strong claim as the birthplace of reggaeton. Some expertssay the musical style began as a meeting of cultures in Panama City. Throught the '70s and '80s, immigrants from the West Indies brought reggae and dancehall rhythms to the country, and Panamanian artists like El General and Renato added a bombastic swagger to the music that drew in audiences across Latin America. This mix also includes the likes of La Atrevida, aka Rude Girl, who helped pioneer the reggaeton sound but is seldom credited. Then, there's one of Panama's most beloved multi-hyphenate stars,Rubén Blades. The salsa and Latin jazz musician is also an actor, lawyer and politician. He's won 11 Grammy Awards and 12 Latin Grammy Awards for his work, which has infused salsa with a sense of social consciousness. The playlist also includes plenty of tropical funk and folk rhythms from bands like Entre Nos, MecániK InformaL and Los Rabanes. Enjoy, and make sure you come back tomorrow to find out whereWorld Cafe's headed next."

After I graduated with a degree in biology from UC Santa Barbara, I began my career as a biologist by doing habitat restoration and fieldwork. I'd go on assignments all around Southern California,tagging rattlesnakesand other wildlife. I thought I'd make this big impact on the world as a scientist. Even though I liked the work I was doing, I didn't really feel like I was accomplishing much. After a stint at a research station on theChannel Islands in California, I saw the callout from ""Naked and Afraid"", asking for participants. To me, it frankly seemed a lot easier than my work, and like a great chance to go on a vacation to Panama. A few weeks later I was on a plane. The show was very real and raw, the cameramen and sound guys weren't allowed to talk to you. The only people allowed to talk to you were producers. Even though the actual living was raw, at the same time, a big part of the show is the social experiment, which is putting two naked strangers together with absolutely nothing in the bush to see how they do. Ultimately for the sake of ratings, I think the producers want to capture bickering, complaining, and whining. So they kept sort ofbaiting me to give them that. I didn't, because that's just not how I was raised. I'm not the kind of person who's just gonna complain about another person and call them useless. I didn't say much and instead, every time they asked me negative questions, I would just redirect to something I was enjoying, like how I found30 pounds of yuca, which is essentially potatoes. I had a lot of fun, but I think that frustrated the producers. To me, ""Naked and Afraid"" is the least interesting thing I've ever done. It was a great stepping stone to get to where I'm at, but it's just a garbage reality show. It's not an important piece of media, it doesn't have aconservation impact. The show came out months after I filmed my episode, and I had returned to my field work. When I looked at the ratings, I saw something like 4 million people had watched my episode. The papers that I had co-authored as a scientist, that took me years to do, barely had 400 reads, and those were by like minded scientists. But rouhgly 4 million normal people had tuned in to me jumping around the jungle,jiggling my junk naked. A lightbulb went off, and I thought, ""well, I know which one of these two things is gonna have more impact."" It was right then and there that I called my boss and told her I was going to pivot to pursuing conservation media. Basically I pivoted the public interest I was getting from ""Naked and Afraid"" into what I'm doing now. My job now is difficult to define, but I'm really sort of a wildlife communicator. I try to bring love and adoration for wild animals, wild places, preservation, conservation and habitat into the hearts and homes of people. Early on, I found a business partner in Eric Evangelista, and we pitched a TV show called ""Extinct or Alive"" to Animal Planet. It went on to run for two seasons, and it was a lot of fun. It kicked off many other opportunities for me, like working onDiscovery's ""Shark Week""and starting my own production company. Since then, I've been able to do things like helprelocate herdsof rogue elephants, and find and hold the nearly extinctFernandina Giant tortoise. Most excitingly, a few months ago, I decided to launch a YouTube channel. It's kind of hilarious, because I've always said that every singleYouTube starwants to be a TV star. And now here I am, kind of going in the opposite direction. I sort of accomplished TV and now I'm branching into YouTube. I'm moving into it to try and reach the younger generations and spread the love of conservation. Because, outside my family, there's nothing to me but conservation. And through that passion, I've gotten to see and do amazing things with and for animals. That's for the little boy in me, dreams coming to fruition."

Calling the petition “a retrograde step in promoting cultural harmony, unity and peace” that has “no merit in it”, Justice Sunil B Shukre and Justice Firdosh P Pooniwalla schooled the petitioner, a cine worker, on the joys of cross-border cultural cooperation: “Arts, music, sports, culture, dance and so on are the activities which rise above nationalities, cultures and nations and truly bring about peace, tranquility, unity and harmony in nation and between nations.” The petitioner had sought directives from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Home Affairs prohibiting the employment of Pakistani actors, technicians, singers, musicians and lyricists in India. Over the last decade, the casualties of the political chill between India and Pakistan have, sadly, been arts, culture and sports. In the early 2010s, the success of Pakistani serials such as Humsafar (2011) and Zindagi Gulzar Hai (2012) had made room for Indian television channels such as Zindagi to stream syndicated shows from across the border and for Pakistani stars like Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan to sign up projects in Bollywood. In music, the popularity of Atif Aslam or Rahat Fateh Ali Khan made their nationality irrelevant. The September 2016 Uri attack put an end to these cross-border exchanges with resolutions from the Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association and the Federation of Western India Cine Employees barring Pakistani artistes from working in the Indian film industry. In 2019, the Pulwama strikes brought forth a resolution by the All-Indian Cine Workers Association, upholding the 2016 ban. Yet, there’s no denying the ameliorative effect that sports and cultural exchanges can have on relationships weighed down by shared trauma and shrill narratives of parochial nationalism. The sight of a Pakistani fan rooting for both her team’s victory andVirat Kohli’s success at the recent Asia Cup or the massive fan following that actor Fawad Khan has in India or thatDilip Kumarenjoyed in Pakistan show what entrenched political positions often miss: That when it comes down to the people, reconciliation — and hope — can come in many forms. In a song by your favourite musician or a century from the cricketer you adore, or even, in the form of your favourite star from across the border, lighting up the big screen with his dimples and twinkling eyes.

[+] Afghanistan, Sunday, Oct. 8, 2023. (AP Photo/Omid Haqjoo) A series of earthquakes hit the Zenda Jan district in Herat province, western Afghanistan, on Sunday October 8, 2023. The strongest earthquake–with a 6.3 magnitude according to the USGS–was also felt in the neighboring countries of Iran, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. At least 2,500 people were killed and more than 9,000 injured in Afghanistan, local authorities said. It's one of the deadliest earthquakes to strike the country in two decades. Earthquakes are common in the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt–a major mountain belt stretching from the Mediterranean through Anatolia, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia into South-East Asia–so seismologist Simon Redfern in an article for The Conversation. Around a fifth of the world's largest earthquakes happened here. The seismic activity is linked to the collision between the Eurasian tectonic plate to the north and the Indian plate to the south. The area marks the scar of the closure of an ancient ocean, the Tethys, which once separated the continents of Gondwana, including most of the landmasses in today's southern hemisphere, and Laurasia, made up of most of the countries that are today in the northern hemisphere. The Tethyan Ocean closed around 40 million years ago. For a long time geologists assumed that as the plates continue to be pushed together, the accumulating energy is released from time to time in the form of earthquakes.

Research published in 2008 suggested a different mechanism to explain why seismic activity in the region seem to be linked to deep-seated fault-lines. According to this model, the earthquakes can be explained by the tearing off of sections of ancient ocean floor sinking into the Earth's mantle beneath east Afghanistan-Pakistan-India. As large portions of rock break off, the stretched crust rebounds and moves up. These movements also deform a superficial fault network stretching west, triggering earthquakes. In combination with poor construction standards, most building in rural areas are made of mud bricks, such shallow earthquakes can cause widespread devastation."

Only31 shipswill be allowed through the canal per day from November 1, down from circa36 to 38 dailyship crossings during normal operations. The announcement was a further cut from the earlier figure of 32, imposed in August. That restriction caused abacklogof hundreds of vessels waiting to cross the canal. Ships that usually crossed the canal in two-and-a-half days had to wait more than nine to make the journey, Insider previously reported. The situation has become so dire that some shipping firms have paid millions of dollars to buy an earlier place in line. The CEO of the gas-shipping company Avance Gas said during the company's second-quarter earnings call in September that it had put up$2.4 millionto win an auction held by the canal authorities to cut the line. The canal authority reported thattraffic had returned to normalby early September. As of October 2, there were about95 boatswaiting to cross the canal, However, analysts at Project44, a supply chain platform, previously told Insider the upcoming holiday season could add further strain on the popular shipping route. Unlikethe Suez Canal, which relies on seawater, the Panama Canal uses freshwater from an artificial lake to supply its waterway. But after an unusually dry year, the watershed of rivers and brooks that usually feed into the lake has been particularly meager, leaving Lake Gatun with about 80 feet of water. It would usually have about 87. Because of this, the canal authority has had to ration the transit through the Panama Canal locks,per the AP. Ricaurte Vásquez Morales, the administrator of the canal, previously predicted the canal's income could fall by as much as $200 million next year because of the reduced traffic. He told French international news outlet France 24 that the El Niño climate pattern could worsen the situation further. ""We have to find other solutions to remain a relevant route for international trade. If we don't adapt, we are going to die,"" Vásquez told France24."

<li>Cavendish, the most commonly available banana variety, is facing the risk of extinction.</li>
<li>A fungus that ravages roots … [+6944 chars]",Panama,"Each year, humans worldwide eat over 100 billion bananas, most of which are a type called the Cavendish. But perhaps not for long. A fungal diseasethreatens to wipe Cavendish bananasoff the face of the Earth. Some scientists are genetically modifying the fruit to be more resistant to disease. But the best solution to the problem, some argue, is for farmers to completely overhaul banana production and stop growing only one variety of fruit altogether. There are over 1,000 varieties ofbananas, but about 47% that humans eat are Cavendish bananas (Musa acuminata). Cavendish dominates the global banana market for several reasons. One, it's resistant to some of the major banana-killing diseases; two, it has a long shelf life; and three, farmers can typically grow more Cavendish bananas than other varieties on the same amount of land. ""Because of all these reasons, Cavendish becomes a very practical product,"" journalist Dan Koeppel, author of the book ""Banana: The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World,"" told Insider. But the Cavendish is under threat from a fungus that infects the plant. The infection is called Panama Disease (Fusarium wilt) tropical race 4. TR4 infection starts in the banana tree's roots and then spreads, ultimately disabling the plant's ability to absorb water or conduct photosynthesis. Eventually, the tree dies as a result. What's happening to Cavendish bananas has happened before to another popular banana variety calledGros Michel. Gros Michel was the ""main export banana in the first half of last century,"" James Dale, a professor and leader of the banana biotechnology program at Queensland University of Technology, told Insider. But a predecessor to TR4, called tropical race 1, began infecting bananas in 1876. By the 1950s, it had completely decimated Gros Michel farms, forcing banana producers across the globe to look for a new variety. In the following years, ""Cavendish became the leading export banana replacing Gros Michel because it was immune to TR1,"" Dale added. In 1997, scientists detected a new strain (TR4) near Darwin, Australia, that infected Cavendish. By 2015, it had spread to the banana farms in Queensland, the largest banana-producing state in Australia. ""Since then it has spread to India and China, the world's largest producers of bananas. It has also spread to the Middle East and Africa and very recently was found in South America,"" Dale told Insider. Some plant pathologists don't believe that the Cavendish banana will meet the same fate as Gros Michel. ""The disease moves slowly, so we have at least a decade before the impact is drastic,"" Dale said. Also, many scientists are working on TR4-resistant Cavendish or a resistant replacement for Cavendish. For example, Dale and his colleagues have developed agenetically modified Cavendish called QCAV-4, which they said is highly resistant to TR4. Another research group led by scientists at the University of Cambridge is exploringgraftingas a possible solution. Grafting tissue from one plant onto another can alter certain characteristics of that plant, like making it more resistant to disease, per the University of Cambridge. Another team at theTaiwan Banana Research Instituteis attempting a form of natural selection. The team takes Cavendish seedlings and exposes them to TR4. The small portion of seedlings that fair best then go onto additional experiments to ultimately help the Cavendish evolve to become resistant to TR4, absent ofgenetic modification. ""I would say with certainty that there will be a solution before the export market for Cavendish is severely affected,"" Dale added. But some banana experts argue that such solutions won't work long term. ""It's true that there is some resistance, but I'd say right now, nobody is even close to solving the problem,"" Koeppel told Insider, adding ""The answer is going to be the end of monoculture. The answer is variety."" He suggests that replacing the current banana cultivar with a new disease-resistant variety is a short-term solution because the fungi can also come up with a new and more powerful strain in the future. The real solution is to mass produce and sell more than one banana variety because the more genetically diverse bananas are, the less likely they'll be susceptible to diseases, he said. Plus, it would also reduce the dependence of humans on one type of banana. ""Apples are a huge example of this. Today If I go to any supermarket in the US, I will find between five and 30 apple varieties,"" Koeppel said. ""Apple growers are going nuts trying to introduce new varieties naturally as well as through hybridization, and genetic modification."" This reduces the risk of disease, offersmore varietyto customers, and as a result, ""apple growersare still making a lot more money because of this,"" he said. The problem with bananas, Koeppel said, is that there are far fewer varieties, and they're all cheap. ""If you add variety, the investment will pay off very quickly because suddenly some people will pay $4 a pound for certain bananas,"" Koeppel told Insider. Dale, on the other hand, isn't so sure. ""Price is the driver,"" of banana sales in his country Australia. He added, ""Most people will purchase Cavendish because it is cheap."" Introducing a wider variety of bananas would not only drive up costs but would also require a major overhaul in how we transport bananas — since you can't just store them in freezers for long periods like apples, Dale said. ""The export market is dependent on harvesting Cavendish green and then inducing ripening by ethylene gassing. This is done during transport and is very tightly controlled and tailored to Cavendish,"" Dale said, adding, ""If there were multiple varieties of bananas exported then it is likely that each would need specific defined ripening conditions. And of course the price would increase."" There seems to be no single solution to the problem that's working, so far. Perhaps history is bound to repeat itself and Cavendish will no longer be the banana of choice in the near future."

The Central American destination has a skyscraper-studded skyline, almost reminiscent of Miami’s Brickell neighborhood, yet uniquely its own. But step foot on the cobblestone streets of Casco Viejo, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and you’ll find yourself surrounded by neoclassical architecture and elegant French Colonial structures, with wrought-iron balconies fronting sherbet-colored buildings that draw comparisons to New Orleans’ French Quarter. Panama City Skyline on summer night Simultaneously old and new, Panama City is having a moment, and travel experts say the destination is piquing the interest of tourists and resonating with digital nomads and expats, poised to be an “it” destination in 2024. Tocumen International Airport’s new terminal allows for several new direct flights into Panama from the U.S., plus a golden visa and a digital nomad program are easier to secure and access compared to other programs around the world. Panama City is a mix of old and new. Depending on where you’re from, the architecture may feel familiar. But with those modern skyscrapers and the European flair, plus the Spanish and Afro-Caribbean culture, Panamá City provides a diverse experience that can’t be found anywhere else, says Ivan Saprov, founder and CEO at Voyagu, which connects travelers with travel agents. “At the same time all the perks of a big city are there, including both authentic and haute cuisine restaurants plus pedestrian areas,” he says. For vacationers, the small, tropical country has everything from rainforests to beaches on both coastlines, the Caribbean and Pacific, all within driving distance of Panamá City, says Mercedes Zach, a travel agent and expert with Asaptickets. What’s more, the development of places like Pearl Island means that travelers can have a two-for-one experience in the vibrant city and on a secluded island, a short helicopter ride away. Casco Viejo is a UNESCO World Heritage site.  Of course, there’s the perennially popular Panama Canal Zone, too, where you can get an in-depth look at the intricate system of locks that operates the canal, Zach says. Ahead, the reasons behind Panama City’s allure for both travelers and those looking for a second home. Why Visit Casco Viejo, Panama In 2024? Put on your comfiest shoes and take a stroll through the Casco Viejo, Panama neighborhood, gawking at the array of architecture and cooling down with a raspado (which may look like a snow cone, but is sweetened with condensed milk). The area is lined with shops and galleries, including Galeria de Arte Inigena, where you can find handmade crafts like jewelry, animal figurines carved from tagua palm seeds and hammocks. Revving up the excitement in the historic neighborhood is Sofitel Legend Casco Viejo’s recent arrival, which brings a French brand of luxury to the area. The hotel’s 159 chic guest rooms have taken over the former Union Club, which was established at the beginning of the 20th century and frequented by Albert Einstein and Queen Elizabeth II. The infinity ledge pool at Sofitel Legend Casco Viejo. The historic building retains its beautiful French Colonial façade. Inside, find artful assemblages of encaustic tiles on the floors, climbing the walls and trimming the fountains—and, most importantly, the glossy turquoise and gold ones showcased in the lobby that form a map of the Panama Canal. A little bit harder to find is the hotel’s secret rum bar Arcano, which is hidden behind a library shelf on the top floor and requires a unique passcode to enter. Mixologists can read guests’ tarot cards to help reveal which rum-forward cocktails are “written in their stars.” A tiled map of the Panama Canal at Sofitel Legend Casco Viejo. Anchoring the hotel is a terrace with an oceanfront infinity pool, and many of the rooms are outfitted with wrought-iron and brass balconies that provide views of the water as well as the glimmering skyline. The hotel has five restaurants and bars, from seafood-forward Caleta, helmed by Michelin-starred Executive Chef Lorenzo Di Gravio, to Vera Cafe, a cute lobby-level jewel box serving croissants, pastries, sandwiches and coffee. The new Sofitel Legend Casco Viejo opened in the historic Union Club building. Across the street from Sofitel Legend is Panama's Teatro Nacional, which was recently restored to its former splendor and is the stage for evening performances. The must-snag brunch reservation is at Casa Catedral, where vintage cars fill the airy space. The neighborhood is also home to BioMuseo, a museum focused on biodiversity that opened right before the pandemic and is the first Frank Gehry-designed building in the region. At Museo de la Mola, see, on dispaly, 200 molas, which are artistic and colorful blouse panels with elaborate patterns crafted by Guna women using a reverse appliqué technique. Panama’s Shorter-Term Work And Golden Visas Those who visit Panama City often want to stick around longer and get to know the city even better. To attract more digital nomads, the government rolled out a short-term work visa that’s available for up to nine months and costs $300—the only caveat being you need to earn about $3,000 USD monthly to qualify, points out Franklin Forbes, who is Panamanian-American and the founder and CEO of Blistey, a travel website and app for the BIPOC community. Skyline of Panama City at blue hour “Some of the things that make Panama City appealing to digital nomads is its proximity to the United States, its rich culture, and the fact that many of its residents are bilingual, especially in the capital,” Forbes says. Fast internet and a fast metro system that’s growing and linking neighborhoods also makes it easy on those with short-term visas, he says. Also, a few years ago, Panama rolled out its “Golden Visa” program, which allows high-net-worth individuals to become residents by investing $300,000 or more in Panamanian property, which is a far lower threshold than that of other countries. Those who own property can apply for citizenship in five years. Giving Panama a competitive edge is the fact that it doesn’t tax income that’s earned abroad. The Santa Maria gated community offers Panamá luxury, complete with restaurants, bars, pools, a ... [+] full-service spa; a Jack Nicklaus designed golf course and more. To meet the interest, communities like The Santa Maria are appealing to expats, global investors and retirees who want to live abroad in a community setting with access to a thrumming museum and culinary scene. Top design firms like La Maison by Fendi and Allegra are building in the gated community, where inventory includes luxury apartments, high-end single-family homes and opulent condos. Plus, residents of The Santa Maria have access to amenities like pickleball courts, pools, and an 18-hole, 72-par signature Jack Nicklaus golf course with panoramic views of the Panama City skyline. The course is hosting the 2024 Latin American Amateur Golf Championships."

<ul><li>Iain Cameron and his wife Brioni left Scotland and move… [+7157 chars]",Panama,"This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Iain Cameron, a 36-year-oldYouTuber and adventurer, from Glasgow, Scotland. It has been edited for length and clarity. The idea ofliving on a boat cameto me one day, in 2016, when I stumbled across a video of sailboats in the tropics. When I started working remotely, I figured I could do my job from a boat rather than my sofa in rainy Glasgow, Scotland. The day I presented my wife Brioni with the idea to sell everything we owned to move onto a boat, her first response was ""but I hate boats."" Besides, we both had stable jobs in Scotland: Brioni was an elementary school teacher and I worked in tech as an international technical trainer. Eventually, we came up with a plan to test the idea and it worked out. For over two years now, living on a boat has made us stronger, more confident, and more appreciative. I think we've traveled through almost 25 countries and sailed over 12,000 miles. First, we tested the idea by sailing on my dad's boat near our home. Our first experience was wet and cold, but later we sailed a catamaran near Edinburgh, Scotland. It went much better. A few months later, we chartered a catamaran out of Dubrovnik, Croatia with the goal of spending two weeks in the Adriatic Sea. On our return, we were still talking to each other and we still wanted to be on the boat together. A month passed and we moved to the final stage of selling everything we had to raise funds tobuy our own boat. We sold most of our things through Facebook Marketplace and eBay. The remaining stuff was sold to friends and family. The only items we didn't sell were two guitars that we loved too much to part with. We were talking with a guy on Facebook Messenger who said he had a boat for sale in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The United Kingdom shut down for the pandemic, but when the lockdown lifted for a few weeks, we put our apartment on the market, bought one-way tickets to the islands, and left with only our backpacks. When we arrived, we found out it was something of a scam. The boat was trashed. We repaired a lot of it at our expense before the original owner told us the deal was off and we had to get off the boat. He released our deposit and we effectively became homeless for a few months, backpacking our way up through the Caribbean in search of a different boat to buy. During that time, we boat sat for a couple we had met in the boat yard and even lived in a shipping container. We eventually found a boat to buy through YachtWorld, which is like the auto trader of boats around the world, in December 2020. Our boat is a Leopard 47 built by Robertson & Caine in 2005. It's a catamaran with 4 queen size beds each with en suite, a galley or a small kitchen, a saloon, and a cockpit. It was a wreck and needed huge amounts of work. We did — and do — all our boat work ourselves. Everything on a boat wants to break, given the harsh salty environment. A simple mistake can result in sinking. Moreover, traveling from point A to B takes planning. A passage usually lasts a few days and when you're tired you can't just drop the anchor for sleep. Most people think life on the water is just sunshine and bikinis, but it also includes fixing plumbing and getting in the water to clean the barnacles off your hull. Our most recent challenges have been passage related. We recently crossed the Pacific Ocean, which took us 40 days. Each day, we alternated spending eight hours on watch and eight hours asleep. In that time, we faced lightning storms, huge waves, failing engines, no wind, too much wind, a broken oven, and ripped sails. Our food supply was destroyed by weevils and we had our steering system fail in the middle of the night, which almost resulted in us having to abandon ship thousands of miles from another living soul. But we wouldn't change anything for the world. We've been fortunate enough to form amazing friendships across the globe. We usually use the phrase ""we will keep doing it unless a more exciting adventure comes along,"" but living on a boat is an exciting lifestyle — even in the quiet moments. Our monthly energy costs are quite small at around $50, and our carbon footprint has almost vanished, as we travel using the power of the wind 99% of the time. Very rarely do we actually use our engines. We generate 100% of our electrical power from solar panels on the roof. We catch most of our food fishing with a hand reel or spear, and we find our fruit and vegetables from local markets when we dock. Anchoring at a dock is free, pretty much everywhere we've been, but we've had to pay marine reserve fees in someplaces like BonaireandGuna Yala, Panama. These usually cost around $10 a night. Our monthly expenses are in the region of $1,400. That covers food, fuel, Starlink internet, and most repair parts we need. Months fluctuate a lot, so it's hard to land an exact number. When we spent 40 days sailing across the Pacific, we didn't spend any money. But when we anchored we had to buy lots of food and parts for everything that broke so our bill was much higher. We enjoy the process of filming and editing our weeklyYouTube episodes, but our big challenge is growing our audience. To help us reach more people, we launched theRed Seas websiteand are currently on a mini world tour. We also host and maintain websites for people, and work with a boat navigation startup. We've been invited to speak at many boating events and clubs around the world, including the Southampton International Boat Show in the UK and the Annapolis Boat Show in the US. We alsoset up some Patreonmeet-ups to thank those who support us in person. At the heart of all that Red Seas does, we hope to inspire everyone to take the leap and find their own adventure. That may be sailing, van life, parenthood, or who knows what else. If we can be an example of what happens when you go both feet in, perhaps others won't be so afraid. The adventure is usually far better than you could've imagined in the first place. If you live on a boat full time or have an adventurous living situation and would like to share your story, email Manseen Logan at mlogan@insider.com."

[+] with ships as colorful objects. This is the Panama Canal like you’ve never seen it before. An image captured from space contains hundreds of ships on their way along a 50-mile journey between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This isn’t a single moment frozen in time. The confetti-like specks indicate ships moving through the waterway over the course of three years. The European Space Agency shared the fascinating satellite view of the famous canal on Friday. Hundreds of Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite radar images covering 2020 to 2022 are compressed together to create the view. ESA assigned different colors to the ships for each year, so blue is 2020, green is 2021 and red is 2022. Between 13,000 and 14,000 ships pass through the canal in a single year, according to the Panama Canal Authority. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission consists of two satellites. The orbiters peer down on Earth to monitor icebergs, flooding, drought, crop health, earthquakes and changes in Antarctica. “Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites carry radar instruments to provide an all-weather, day-and-night supply of imagery of Earth’s surface, making it ideal to monitor ship traffic,” ESA said in a statement. The full Sentinel-1 satellite view of the Panama Canal shows ship traffic as seen in hundreds of ... [+] radar images compressed together covering 2020-2022. Spending time with the image reveals patterns in ship movement, including favored gathering places for ships waiting to enter the canal. Look closer at the ocean surface above and below the canal to see a scattering of ships on approach or heading away to their ultimate destinations. ESA likened the ships to “shining jewels.” ESA has an interactive version of the image that you can explore by clicking on circles to zoom in on notable parts of the view. Highlights include Panama City (seen as a bright white area to the south) and Lake Gatun, easily spottable as a large, jagged-edged body of water near the northern side of the canal. Gatun supplies water that helps the canal function. It’s been a rough year for the lake. Severe drought in Panama has impacted the amount of freshwater available to fill the canal’s locks. That’s led to restrictions on ship traffic, and could even take a toll on holiday shopping in the U.S. The canal authority has whittled ships down from an average of 37 per day to 31 per day over the past month, ESA said. That has global repercussions for the movement of goods. A cargo ship navigates through the Panama Canal in the area of the Cocoli Locks, in Panama City on ... [+] Agust 25, 2023. (Photo by IVAN PISARENKO/AFP via Getty Images) The drought outlook remains grim. The Panama Canal Authority said water conservation measures are expected to remain in place into the 2024 rainy season, which typically runs from May through January. It’s one facet of how climate change is affecting the canal and global maritime trade. The Panama Canal is a marvel of engineering. It officially opened in 1914 and has since provided a valuable shortcut for vessels moving between the Atlantic and the Pacific. The canal acts as a connection point for 1,920 ports across 170 countries. The ESA multi-year satellite view communicates the scale of the Panama Canal and the tremendous load of ship traffic it handles every year. It also shows the versatility of the Sentinel-1 satellites. They can go from tracking the movement of icebergs to following the flow of maritime commerce. Our eyes up in space tell stories we can’t always see from ground level."

Each runner chose one person to whom they dedicated their run. Spouses, children, friends, siblings, neighbors, and colleagues ran for someone they knew who either was killed, taken captive or injured during Russia’s ongoing war inUkraine. The crowd cheered the runners, and many in the audience wept while waiting for participants at the finish line. Amid the lively backdrop of Ukrainian songs, joy and sorrow intermingled in the air as life carried on despite the war. The organizers of the run called it the “World’s Longest Marathon” — “because no race has lasted as long as Ukraine has been fighting for its freedom.” Around 13,000 people across the world registered for the event. Those competing remotely could run any distance they wanted and were encouraged to post about it on social media. The race was hosted by Nova Post, Ukraine’s most prominent private delivery company, with the dual purpose of honoring the defenders and raising funds to bolster Ukraine’s air defense system. “We want to thank and support our defenders, doctors, rescuers, sappers, and volunteers — all the strong and resilient marathoners who do not stop even for a moment for the sake of each of us,” said the project description. Nova Post has delivered starter kits to 65 countries across all continents, said Inna Popereshniuk, co-founder of Nova Post. She dedicated her race to six colleagues who were killed and 17 injured in a Russian attack on the Nova Post depot in the Kharkiv region on Oct. 21. Volodymyr Rutkovskyi, a 31-year-old veteran, completed the course walking. In mid-June, he sustained a severe injury when a Russian projectile struck his right leg during Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the Zaporizhzhia region. After months of rehabilitation, he now uses a prosthetic limb and participated in the event to pay tribute to two fallen comrades, Zheka and Tykhyi, who were killed in eastern Ukraine. “They did a lot for our country, and sadly, they could have done much more if they were alive,” he said. “But their struggle continues. We will do everything for them and in their honor.” He crossed the finishing line with his gaze obscured by the low brim of a black Panama hat. He sported running shorts, which revealed his prosthetic leg. “I don’t really have words to describe what I’m feeling,” he said. “Many of our comrades won’t be ever alive, and I won’t be able to shake their hand or sit down with them.” But while taking part, he reminded himself that the memory of them remains for a lifetime. “And we need to carry their cross, just as we do our own,” Rutkovskyi added. Some people came from other cities to the capital to participate in the race. 24-year-old Tetiana Boiko came to Kyiv from the western Ternopil region. “This is a token of gratitude to everyone who defends and has defended our country. I believe it shows that we are not indifferent to what is happening right now,” she explained. Her bib bore the name of Volodymyr Semanyshyn, a young man from her hometown who sustained injuries while attaching an explosive device to a drone, resulting in a sudden detonation that left him without arms. “There are many young men from my town who are worth running for in this race,” said Boiko. “However, I believe he needs this support now. I would like to convey this message to all compassionate people so that they join in fundraising”. Boiko tries to draw attention to Semanyshyn’s case because he has only elderly parents who can’t afford to cover the expensive rehabilitation that he needs. She had longed to participate in a marathon, and this was the race she finally mustered the courage to enter. “And it turned out that my first ‘marathon’ became truly special,"" she said. ""It demonstrates our compassion, and it’s the least we can do."" ___ Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"

Drugs weighing 137kg (302lbs) were found on a Panamanian-registered ship carrying bananas at Sheerness, Kent.  The haul was likely to have had a UK street value of more than £10m, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. The cocaine was found in four large holdalls in the sea chest, an intake area for sea water to assist stability. The ship was destined for the Netherlands but, on the basis of information supplied by the NCA, specialist teams searched the vessel when it docked at Sheerness Port on 14 October. The NCA said a Metropolitan Police Dive Unit took five hours to recover the drugs after an underwater search of the ship's hull in reduced visibility. It is one of only two underwater concealments of class A drugs of its kind ever discovered in the UK, the last being at Bristol in November 2021 when 46kg (101.4lbs) of cocaine was detected. NCA operations manager David Phillips said it was an ""extremely rare and sophisticated concealment"".   The crime agency said it believed the drug's destination was likely to have been the Netherlands, and it was working with law enforcement partners there and in Panama. Stephen Whitton, deputy director of Border Force Maritime Command, said: ""The combined efforts of the NCA, the Met Police and Border Force, have prevented £10m worth of cocaine from plaguing our streets and countries nearby.""

The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) says it has been forced to make the decision due to the driest October since records began in 1950. The El Niño weather phenomenon has contributed to the severe drought, the ACP says. It is expected to increase the cost of shipping goods around the world. The Panama Canal greatly reduces the time and distance for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, between 13,000 and 14,000 ships use it annually, according to the canal authority. A naturally occurring El Nino climate pattern associated with warmer-than-usual water in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean is contributing to Panama's drought. Water levels in Gatun Lake, the rainfall-fed reservoir that is the main source of water used in the canal's lock system, have ""continued to decline to unprecedented levels for this time of year,"" according to the ACP. Starting from 3 November, booking slots will be cut to 25 per day from an already reduced 31 per day, the ACP said. That number will be further reduced over the next three months to 18 slots per day from the start of February 2024. In recent months, the ACP has imposed various passage restrictions to conserve scarce water. Earlier this year, authorities cut the number of ships passing through the canal for the first time ever. The measures already in place have caused long delays, with tens of ships having to wait to use the canal. Those delays have ""pushed shipping rates higher elsewhere by decreasing the globally available number of vessels,"" according to an analyst note from the US Energy Information Administration.  Delays for some gas transporters were at record highs in Panama, pushing up the cost of shipping liquefied gas from the US, it added."

Of course, Latin America is a big place… So where are some of the best spots to consider here for those on a monthly budget of $2,000 or less? I’ve been exploring expat opportunities the world over for 30 years. I’ve traveled to, lived in, and invested in scores of countries and, through my business, I’ve helped thousands more people to do the same. Of course, your perfect place in the sun will depend on many personal factors, but to get you started in your search, here’s my pick of five Latin America expat havens where you can likely upgrade your lifestyle and slash your cost of living. #1: Panama Panama is a premier retirement and business haven offering the best infrastructure in Central America. The View from Ancon Hill, Panama City, Panama For those looking to start a business or invest in a market ripe for profit, Panama should be high on your list. With its excellent health care, English-speaking locals, affordable rentals, warm weather, low crime, and a more mature expat community, it’s also a great option for senior digital nomads. In-country, the small, close-knit town of Chitré topped the rankings in the annual Live And Invest Overseas Retirement Index. A couple could live comfortably here on a monthly budget of $2,000. Rent for a furnished, two-bedroom apartment in a desirable part of town will cost around $800 per month. To run a car here will cost around $60 a month and a couple will spend an average of $425 a month on groceries. Pensionado Visa holders are eligible for discounts off utility bills, airline tickets, doctor’s bills, hotel stays, and more, further reducing the cost of living. #2: Mexico It’s easy to feel at home in Mexico. For those moving here from the U.S., it’s as accessible as it gets—you can drive here should you choose. It’s a vast country with two long coasts and with beach resorts, mountain towns, and colonial cities to choose from, you can take your pick of lifestyle options here. San Miguel de Allende, Mexico For those seeking a more authentic Mexican lifestyle and lower costs than those on offer in the popular tourist resorts, consider Oaxaca City. Here, you’ll also find charming colonial architecture, a vibrant culture, a moderate climate, reasonable prices, flight connections to the States, and high-quality health care. Rentals here start at around $400 a month, lunch at a local spot can be enjoyed for $5, and a bus ride will cost less than $1. Overall, a budget of $2,000 would be more than sufficient for an expat couple here. #3: Belize  Warm, welcoming, independent, and private, Belize is an English-speaking Caribbean paradise. This small country—just a little larger than Massachusetts—is home to a population of around 400,000. If you like wide-open spaces and small-town living then Belize could be your perfect overseas haven. Belize offers beautiful beaches and mountain escapes At Live And Invest Overseas, our preferred destination within Belize is the seaside town of Corozal, in the north of the country. Here, you can rent a two-bedroom, Belize-style home for around $500 per month and, all-in, a couple could live well here on a monthly budget of $1,403. Legal residency is easy to obtain in Belize, and foreign residents pay no tax in Belize on non-Belize income. The one caveat when it comes to Belize is heath care. While facilities and standards are improving, they are limited. For those with serious health concerns or existing medical conditions, it’s best to look elsewhere in the region. #4: Colombia North Americans are quickly catching on to the charms of this progressive country which can offer a serious lifestyle upgrade for those on a more modest budget. In the city of Medellín, an expat favorite, a couple could enjoy a comfortable lifestyle on a monthly budget of $1,384. Rentals in the city’s Laureles neighborhood—recently voted the coolest neighborhood in the world—are on the market for $650 a month. A couple will spend in the region of $370 on groceries and $100 on electricity and internet costs each month. A meal out for two will cost around $25. In Medellin, Colombia a couple could live well on a monthly budget of $1,384 Health care is another major selling point for Colombia and Medellín in particular, as this is where many of the country’s best hospitals are located, including the Joint Commission International-accredited Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe. Entidades Promotoras de Salud (EPS) are basic health care plans that every Colombia resident must have by law. These plans cost 12.5% of your monthly income, or pension for retirees. They cover medical, vision, and dental at a basic level. Many expats opt to pay out of pocket for additional costs as health care is so affordable. Standard doctor and dentist visits typically cost around $50. The city also boasts an excellent public transport system comprising a metro, metro cable, bus, and tram, as well as taxis, ride-hailing apps, and public bicycles. It’s the best choice in Latin America for car-free living. #5: Dominican Republic Blessed with white-sand beaches, virgin jungle, and mountain hideaways, the Dominican Republic is one of the Caribbean’s largest tourist destinations. The Dominican Republic offers affordable Caribbean island living  For those looking to settle in for a longer stay, one of the world’s most user-friendly residency and citizenship programs is on offer here. It’s also where you can enjoy affordable Caribbean island living with a strong European flavor thanks to the thriving expat population. On the Dominican Republic’s northeast coast, in the Samana Peninsula, signs for expat-run businesses in English, French, Italian, and Spanish abound; and French and Italian food brands line the shelves of specialty grocery stores, too. It’s here you’ll find the resort town of Las Terrenas, known as the “St. Tropez of the Caribbean.” The French settled Las Terrenas generations ago, and their influence lingers. People greet each other with kisses on both cheeks and patisseries offer fresh-baked pain au chocolat and baguettes. The lifestyle here is more affordable than you might expect. Condos close to one of Las Terrenas’ most beautiful beaches are for sale from under $100,000. Long-term rentals can be secured on a six-month or longer lease from $600. On a budget of $2,000 a month a couple would be comfortable here."

About an hour after taking off from Tocumen International Airport headed for Tampa at 9:36 local time, the flight was ordered back to Panama. After landing, it was moved to an isolated area of the tarmac and emptied of its 144 passengers. Explosives teams searched the plane for the “suspicious object,” only to find an adult diaper wrapped in a black plastic bag was responsible for the trouble. “We had it on a secure runway where police special explosives canine units and special forces examined the object, and found it to be an adult diaper, ruling out any risk,” Jose Castro, head of the airport security team with Panama’s Civil Aeronautics Authority, wrote in a post on X. Authorities subsequently ruled out any kind of threat, Copa Airlines said in a statement. Passengers then re-boarded the same airplane, which took off again around 2pm and landed in Florida without further incident at 6:54pm local time, Tampa International Airport’s communications manager confirmed."

Last ye… [+2844 chars]",Panama,"A company which enables its clients to search a database of billions of images scraped from the internet for matches to a particular face has won an appeal against the UK's privacy watchdog. Last year, Clearview AI was fined more than £7.5m by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for unlawfully storing facial images. Jack Mulcaire, Clearview AI's lawyer, said the firm was ""pleased"". The ICO said it would ""take stock"" of the judgement. Clearview AI offers its clients a system that works like a search engine for faces - users upload a photo and it finds matches in a database of billions of images it has collected.  It then provides links to where matching images appear online. In March, Clearview's founder Hoan Ton-That told the BBC it had run nearly a million searches for US police, helping them to solve a range of crimes, including murders. He also revealed its database contained 30 billion images scraped from the internet. Critics argue that law enforcement's use of Clearview's technology puts everyone into a ""perpetual police line-up"".  And prior to the ICO's action, now ruled unlawful, France, Italy and Australia had also taken action against the firm. In the past Clearview AI had commercial customers, but since a 2020 settlement in a case brought by US civil liberties campaigners, the firm now only accepts clients who carry out criminal law enforcement or national security functions. Clearview does not have UK or EU clients, but its customers are based in the US and in other countries including Panama, Brazil, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic, Tuesday's judgement revealed. In simple terms, Clearview succeeded in appealing against the ICO's fine and enforcement action because it was used solely by law enforcement bodies outside the UK. The three-member tribunal at the First-tier Tribunal, which heard the appeal, concluded that although Clearview did carry out data processing related to monitoring the behaviour of people in the UK, the ICO ""did not have jurisdiction"" to take enforcement action or issue a fine. Explaining the decision James Castro-Edwards, data privacy lawyer from Arnold & Porter told the BBC that, ""Clearview only provided services to non-UK/EU law enforcement or national security bodies and their contractors."" ""UK data protection law (UK GDPR) provides that acts of foreign governments fall outside its scope; it is not for one government to seek to bind or control the activities of another sovereign state"". In response to the judgement, the ICO said that it would carefully consider next steps but added: ""It is important to note that this judgement does not remove the ICO's ability to act against companies based internationally who process data of people in the UK, particularly businesses scraping data of people in the UK, and instead covers a specific exemption around foreign law enforcement."" Will Richmond-Coggan, a data protection partner at law firm Freeths, agreed, arguing that even though the appeal was allowed, the decision underlined that scraping large volumes of publicly available data was an activity to which UK data protection rules could apply.  ""The appeal turned exclusively on the fact that Clearview's customers were overseas national security and law enforcement bodies, and so shouldn't be relied on as granting a blanket permission for such scraping activities more generally."""

[+] communities known as 30A. The white, sandy beaches that decorate the coast of Florida are certainly no secret. In Miami Beach alone—with a full-time population of about 80,000—just under 11 million visitors stay overnight in the small beach town every year. A similar story can be seen across many coastal towns across the Sunshine State. However, with an incredible 1,350 miles of shoreline, some of Florida’s beach towns fly under the radar. In the case of the collection of small, coastal communities that make up the 24-mile stretch known as 30A, it is this anonymity that created the area’s relaxed and private reputation. Stretching across 24 miles along the coast, 30A sits between Panama City to the east and Dustin to ... [+] the west. Tucked away on the western side of the Florida Panhandle, 30A—named after the two-lane country highway that runs along the coast—is positioned between popular destinations Panama City and Destin. Laid along the “Emerald Coast,” the shoreline region is home to a long span of rustic, soft sand beaches that touch against the cerulean waters of the Gulf of Mexico, rivaling even the best of the Caribbean Islands. Dotted along these shores are distinct, picturesque beach towns, each with a character and appeal of its own. Though each town differs in aesthetic, many offer community amenities like clubhouses and events.  It’s no surprise then that this secret treasure is not so secret anymore—the area has seen a significant influx in visitors as of late, says James Watts and Brad Hilderbrand, co-founders of luxury brokerage Coastal Abode. “At some point in the last 10 years, we’ve been the sixth-fastest growing county in the country in terms of population. It used to be a very seasonal area, but there’s been a shift toward more full-time residents, and now there’s year-round activity. ” As the area continues to grow in popularity, waterfront real estate prices have surged.  Despite the newfound popularity and the subsequent increase in commercial and residential development, Watts says that 30A has yet to lose its laid-back vibe. “It still feels friendly; it still feels inviting. What people say around here is that it’s flip-flop luxury.” This completely remodeled home, priced at $7.125 million, features expansive views of Gulf of ... [+] Mexico. Homes in 30A Save for what could be described as a ""beach feel,"" an overarching architectural trend for the area is hard to pin down as many of 30A’s communities feature unique and differing aesthetics and styles. For example, Watts described the town of Rosemary Beach as having an “almost a European village feel with cobblestone streets and a town center” while the next town over, Alys Beach, is a blend of “the Mediterranean and Bermuda, with its emphasis on white, bright beach homes.” Further west, another beach community, WaterColor, is known as an “upscale community made up of beach cottages.” This rendering for 161 Rolling Dunes in Blue Mountain Beach showcases the high-end finishes of many ... [+] new construction projects in 30A. This variation allows a wider range of buyers to find something that suits their preferences, added Watts. “It’s not all uniform; it’s a little bit of everything. Whatever your taste is, you can likely find it.” While styling may differ, many homes throughout 30A boast similar amenities, including golf cart garages, ocean views and access to community facilities, such as swimming pools, fitness centers and spas. Capitalizing on the area's breezy coastal weather, homes often feature outdoor living spaces.  Property Prices in 30A According to the August market update provided by Coastal Abode, the average sale price for the West End of 30A was $1.7 million and for the East End was $3 million. On the high end of those averages was a $10.9 million sale while the lowest-priced sale landed at $484,000. Such a range in pricing reflects the diversity of the 30A market, where properties whose values differ by many millions of dollars can often be within a few blocks of each other, says Watts. In addition to a variety of designs and styles, real estate in 30A is available at a wide range of ... [+] prices. “30A is a hodgepodge—you can have a $15 million, gulf-front home and then down the street a 1950s classic cottage for around a million.” The most expensive homes in the area consist primarily of those located directly off the beach, listing for upward of $20 million. In particular, newer construction beachfront homes—often larger than older homes and decked out with modern amenities—come with the most premium price tags. The stretch of 30A's coast is famous for turquoise waters and white sand, exemplified in this ... [+] tranquil scene from Rosemary Beach. The Vibe of 30A Despite being famous for its pristine beaches, Watts says that 30A has much more to offer than surf and sand. “There’s not this 100 percent focus on the beach. There are exceptional hiking and biking trails, golf courses and incredible restaurants and events.” In recent years, the area has adapted to the arrival of more full-time residents with an increase in commercial offerings. “The longer people stay here, the more they want those things that they’re used to back home—they want restaurants, they want shopping options, they want events. So that’s been driving an increase in these local amenities.” With the recent increase in new residents, restaurants and shopping options have been on the rise.  Many of the towns in 30A were designed with walkability in mind. One town in particular, Seaside, is known as a model for New Urbanism—an urban planning movement that promoted eco-friendly habits by creating walkable neighborhoods. The small beach town’s reputation for ""picturesque perfection"" even drew the attention of Hollywood, with Seaside serving as the filming location for the 1998 film The Truman Show. Grayton Beach, a small historic village, abuts the nearly 2000-acre Grayton Beach State Park.  Surrounding 30A Multiple airports are located within a short distance from the towns of 30A. To the east, the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport in Panama City offers direct flights from all over the country, including major hubs like Atlanta, Denver and Dallas. Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport sits about 40 minutes away from Miramar Beach. Tallahassee is located more than 100 miles to the east or roughly a two-and-a-half-hour drive."

Two rum brands took Platinum medals, and three rums took Gold medals at the 2023 Las Vegas Global Spirit Awards (LVGSA). Although the major rum brands continued to dominate the sales volume, the medallists were all craft distillers. Craft distillers increasingly define the quality standard and dominate the top medal rounds in international spirit competitions. The sole Platinum medallist in the Five Years and Under category, scoring 98/100 points was Karu Distillery, Outcast Rum, 46% ABV, 700 ml. The Karu Distillery is based in a suburb of Sydney called The Devil’s Wilderness. The company was founded in 2018 by husband-and-wife team Nick and Ally Ayres. The distillery has consistently won international spirit competitions in a broad range of spirit categories. Outcast Rum is molasses-based and undergoes a two-week fermentation. It is aged for two to three years in ex-Australian whisky casks. The LVGSA Judging Panel described the Outcast Rum as expressing: Baked molasses cookies, brown sugar, caramel notes, and some dried fruit on the nose. Smooth and oily on the palate with notes of dark dried fruit, caramel, and molasses. The finish is long with notes of baked molasses cookies, some lingering pepperiness, and a touch of bitterness at the end. The Gold medal winners in the Rum Five Years and Under category were Minoki Rum, 40% ABV, 700 ml, scoring 93/100 points, and Distillery Krauss, Rum Master Blend, 48% ABV, 700 ml, scoring 92/100 points. Minoki Rum is a molasses-based rum brand founded in Japan. The company claims it is the first rum producer to finish its spirit in Japanese Mizunara oak casks. Before bottling, the rum is filtered through bleached coral washed ashore. A portion of the sales of Minoki Rum is put aside to fund coral reef rehabilitation. The company also produces an eight-year-old rum that is finished in Japanese cedar (Yoshino Sugi) casks and a 12-year-old rum that is finished in Japanese cherry tree (Sakura) casks. Both expressions are limited edition expressions and filtered through bleached coral before bottling. The LVGSA Judging Panel described the Minoki Rum as featuring: Pronounced molasses/brown sugar and dried tropical fruit notes on the nose. It is smooth and oily on the palate, with a pronounced vanilla flavor, spice notes of cinnamon, and a touch of clove. The finish is long and sweet with a persistent baked molasses note and a slight lingering pepperiness. Distillery Krauss is an Austrian-based craft distiller. Its Rum Master Blend is molasses-based and is matured in barrels of American oak. The LVGSA described it as featuring: Pronounced “funky” rum esters on the nose with notes of tropical fruit, smoked banana/plantain, and vanilla. It's smooth and oily on the palate with a pronounced weight with notes of cooked/smoky banana, semisweet chocolate, dried tropical fruit, vanilla, and coffee with pronounced rum esters typical of funky Jamaican rums. The finish is exceptionally long, with lingering notes of dried tropical fruit, mocha, and rum esters.  Ron Parce, Ron Reserva Especial 8, 40% ABV, 750 ml. The top rum in the Seven Years and Older category and winner of Best Rum was Ron Parce, Ron Reserva Especial 8, 40% ABV, 750 ml, 98/100 points. Parce Rum is based in Chicago. However, the rum is distilled in Pesé, Panama, and is based on sugar cane juice sourced from cane harvested in Colombia, Trinidad, and Panama. Following distillation, the rum is shipped to Colombia for blending, casking, and aging. Although not always easy to find, the rum typically retails in the US for under $20, making it an exceptional value for an eight-year-old rum. The LVGSA Judging Panel described the Parce Rum as featuring: Dried tropical fruits, brown sugar, caramel on the nose, and an herbaceous note of dried tobacco leaf. Very smooth and creamy on the palate with a Crème Brulé quality and pronounced dried fruit, caramel, dried orange zest, a hint of baked molasses cookies, cinnamon spice, and a slightly bitter note. The finish is long with lingering caramel and dried fruit notes. This is a great rum to pair with a cigar. The Ron Parce, Ron Reserva Especial 12, 40% ABV, 750 ml, 92/100 points, won a Gold medal. The Parce Especial 12 is similar to the Parce Especial 8 with a similar flavor profile, although it is smoother on the palate, and the flavors seem a bit more intense. The Especial 12 is produced exactly like the Especial 8 but enjoys four more years of maturation in Colombia. The LVGSA was founded in 2016 and is now in its seventh year. As the oldest and largest spirits competition in Las Vegas, it has consistently exerted a broad national influence. Not only is Las Vegas a significant beverage market, but the city’s burgeoning restaurant and mixology community has increasingly gained a reputation for innovation, placing it on the cutting edge of national trends. Moreover, craft brands that win Platinum and Gold medals in the competition are almost always offered distribution in Nevada. For an aspiring craft distiller, placement in the high-profile Las Vegas market is often critical to obtaining national distribution. The 2023 LVGSA featured an outstanding array of craft rums and offered a variety of taste profiles. All five top rums are consistent medal winners and have an enviable record in international spirit competitions. The five rums have won over 50 medals over the last few years, indicating their outstanding quality is universally recognized. You will find plenty to interest you among these award-winning spirits if you are an aged rum drinker, straight up or in cocktails. See the company’s website for a complete listing of the 2023 Las Vegas Global Spirits Awards winners. Cheers"

I… [+2907 chars]",Panama,"Panama's President Laurentino Cortizo on Friday announced a ban on new metal mining concessions, but maintained a contract with a Canadian company that has sparked massive protests in the country. In a televised address, the president said the government had issued a decree ""declaring a ban on granting new metallic mineral concessions throughout the country."" Cortizo made no mention of the controversial contract with First Quantum Minerals, the Vancouver-based company whose Caribbean copper mine sparked demonstrations over potential environmental impacts and in which protesters have clashed with police. ""All new metal mining applications and also those that are currently in process will be rejected outright,"" the president said, adding that ""this ban will be effective as of today."" Cortizo, who signed the decree before television  cameras, said he made this decision ""taking into account the different positions of society in relation to the issue of mining."" But his announcement did little to quell tempers at a protest by thousands of people that was taking place in the financial center of the capital even as he spoke. Thousands of Panamanians marched again Friday to demand that the contract with the Canadian company, which operates the largest copper mine in Central America, be repealed. ""You who are watching, yes, they are robbing you too,"" protesters chanted as they banged pots and pans and waved Panamanian flags. The demonstrations began a week ago and have drawn thousands of people, an unusual occurrence in this country of 4.2 million inhabitants. ""The government has not been listening to us, it has used all means to repress us and to suppress information,"" said activist and protest organizer Felipe Chon. ""The mine has been a bad deal for the nation, because of the ecological damage they have done,"" protester Alfredo Fonseca told AFP. In the past week, the protests have grown, with street blockades set up in the capital and other cities, including some blocking the Pan-American highway that connects the country with the rest of Central America. Schools were suspended all week and in some areas clashes broke out between stone-throwing protesters and police who fired tear gas at the demonstrators. Protests intensified last Friday after Cortizo signed a bill establishing the mining contract. The demonstrators have been calling for that law to be repealed. The Supreme Court had declared the original contract unconstitutional in 2017, but the government has argued that the new version sets out a minimum annual contributions from the mining company to the state of $375 million, 10 times the amount of the initial agreement. In addition, the company and the government point out that the mine generates 8,000 immediate jobs and 40,000 indirect jobs, and will contribute four percent of the Panamanian GDP. The contract allows the mining company to operate on Panama's Caribbean coast for 20 years, with the chance to extend for another 20. Since February 2019, the open-pit mine has been producing about 300,000 tons of copper concentrate per year."

The protesters are concerned about potential environmental damage from operations at the mine owned by First Quantum, one of the biggest copper extractors in the world. After protests erupted on Friday and continued over the weekend, demonstrators again took to the streets Monday in Panama City and in other provinces, waving placards reading: ""Protect our natural resources,"" and ""Stop destroying our lands."" The government canceled school for the day for fear of riots, as traffic in Panama City was disrupted and some metro stations had to close. Police said 25 people were arrested. Opened in 2019, the open pit Cobre Panama mine, some 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of the capital and 20 km from the Caribbean coast, can produce 300,000 tons of copper per year. In 2021, Panama's Supreme Court ratified a lower court's ruling that the original concession of mining rights granted to subsidiary Minera Panama until 2037 was unconstitutional. Negotiations between the government and First Quantum were reopened and finalized earlier this year. The new contract determines that the company will pay the government at least $375 million each year -- ten times more than previously -- and allows First Quantum to operate in Panama for 20 years, renewable for another 20. But opponents believe the amount is still insufficient, especially given potential threats to the environment, and protesters want a law passed Friday to formalize the agreement to be repealed. ""We are in a fight against the sale of our homeland,"" said labor leader Saul Mendez. The government says the mine generates about 8,000 direct jobs and 40,000 indirect ones, contributing 4 percent to GDP."

The company was fined more than £7.5 million ($9.1 million) last year and ordered to delete the data of U.K. residents after the Information Commissioner’s Office ruled that it was breaching General Data Protection Regulation privacy laws by failing to inform people or gain their consent. ""The company not only enables identification of those people, but effectively monitors their behavior and offers it as a commercial service. That is unacceptable,"" said information commissioner John Edwards at the time. However, Clearview has now successfully appealed that decision, with a judge ruling that the company's activities fell outside the scope of U.K. privacy laws because the data was processed for law enforcement purposes outside the U.K. Clearview's software searched a database of billions of faces to detect matches, for business customers as well as law enforcement bodies. It was trialed in the U.K. by the Metropolitan Police, the Ministry of Defence and the National Crime Agency. However, the company later, after settling a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois in 2020, restricted clients to law enforcement or national security bodies and their contractors. Current customers are believed to include the U.S., Panama, Brazil, Mexico and the Dominican Republic, as well as Ukraine, where it is offering its services for free. And, the tribunal has now ruled, this means that the ICO does not have jurisdiction, as the acts of foreign governments fall outside its remit. The ICO said it's considering its position. ""The ICO will take stock of today’s judgment and carefully consider next steps,"" said a spokesperson. ""It is important to note that this judgment does not remove the ICO’s ability to act against companies based internationally who process data of people in the U.K., particularly businesses scraping data of people in the U.K., and instead covers a specific exemption around foreign law enforcement."" Clearview AI has faced similar legal challenges around the world. It has been found to be in breach of the GDPR in France, Italy and Greece—although it failed, at least initially, to pay the fine levied in France on time, and it's not clear whether it deleted the data as ordered. Action has also been taken against the country in Canada and Australia. Clearview welcomed the latest ruling. ""We are pleased with the tribunal's decision to reverse the UK ICO's unlawful order against Clearview AI,"" said Jack Mulcaire, Clearview AI's general counsel."

In the digital age, the banking and financial industry has witnessed an unprecedented transformation, leveraging technology to streamline operations and enhance customer experience. However, this transition comes with its own set of challenges, one of which is the alarming rise in data leaks and breaches. Based on my years of experience in the design and development of forecast models for regulatory risk and financial figures, I will share some of the insights I've gained on how to overcome those threats. Big Data Leak Incidents To better understand the context of data leaks in the financial sector, let's first go through some of the biggest in history and their impact on users. • Equifax: The Equifax attack in 2017 is one of the most notorious data breaches in history. Equifax, a credit reporting agency, fell victim to a cyberattack that exposed sensitive personal and financial information of nearly 143 million individuals. • Panama Papers: Another case, while not a traditional data breach, is the Panama Papers data leak in 2016. This leak exposed confidential financial documents, implicating numerous high-profile individuals and entities in offshore tax evasion and money laundering. • JPMorgan Chase: This attack shows that even the most reputable financial institutions can be attacked. In 2017, a cyberattack on JPMorgan Chase compromised data belonging to 76 million households and 7 million small businesses. The Dangers Of Financial Data Leaks Data leaks can bring with them a variety of risks and challenges, including: • Identity Theft and Fraud When personal and financial data falls into the hands of cybercriminals due to a data breach, the consequences can be terrible. Cybercriminals can exploit stolen information, such as Social Security numbers, credit card details and account credentials, to perpetrate a range of fraudulent activities. They can open fake bank accounts, apply for loans and credit cards in the victim's name, and make unauthorized transactions. • Market Manipulation Leaking of sensitive financial information, such as insider trading data, can open the door to market manipulation. If cybercriminals gain access to nonpublic information about companies' financial performance, mergers or other significant events, they can exploit this information to make illicit gains. By buying or selling stocks based on this insider information, they can artificially influence stock prices in their favor. • Global Economic Impact The financial world operates as an intricate web of interconnected institutions, transactions and investments. A data breach at one financial institution can have far-reaching consequences that ripple through the global economy. For instance, if a major bank's sensitive information is exposed, it could undermine confidence in the broader banking sector, leading to reduced lending and investment activities. A significant breach might also shake investor confidence and lead to a downturn in stock markets. The interconnectedness of global finance means that disruptions in one part of the world can quickly spread, affecting trade, commerce and investment on a global scale. Possible Solutions And Preventative Measures Fortunately, there are a number of ways you can reduce the risk of data links for your organization. Here are three effective methods. 1. Encryption Encryption plays a pivotal role in ensuring data confidentiality. This involves the use of mathematical algorithms and encryption keys to transform sensitive information into an unintelligible code. This encrypted data can only be decrypted and understood by individuals possessing the correct decryption keys. There are two primary forms of encryption: data-at-rest and data-in-transit. Data-at-rest encryption safeguards information when it's stored on devices or servers, while data-in-transit encryption protects data as it moves across networks. I highly recommend employing both forms. To implement these types of encryption effectively, choose the appropriate encryption algorithms for your company, securely manage your encryption keys, and ensure that the encryption systems you employ are compatible with your existing systems. 2. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) ZKPs are cryptographic tools that enable proof of information without revealing the data itself. In finance, this means transactions, identities and balances can be verified and/or confirmed without disclosing specific sensitive details. Authentication is strengthened, allowing customers to validate their eligibility for loans or transactions without exposing personal information. Market-sensitive data, such as insider trading details, can be validated while preserving confidentiality. ZKPs can also enhance security by proving identity without divulging private identifiers. This essentially means that the companies don't have access to users' sensitive information and don't store it anywhere; there's simply no centralized database with credit card information, Social Security numbers, addresses or other valuable information. Consequently, the probability of a data leak seriously decreases. ZKPs can be a powerful tool for data privacy, but they can also be challenging to integrate. You may face complexities related to computational overhead, performance and the need for specialized cryptographic expertise. To overcome these challenges, consider gradually implementing ZKPs in noncritical systems to gain confidence and team experience. You can also collaborate with experts in this field for guidance. (Full disclosure: My company offers these services, as do others.) 3. Access Control Access control revolves around regulating who can access specific data or systems within an organization. Modern technology allows for granular control over access permissions. Role-based access control (RBAC) assigns permissions based on job roles, while multifactor authentication (MFA) adds layers of security by requiring multiple forms of authentication. While access control is highly effective, it demands careful configuration to avoid human error, which could inadvertently lead to data breaches. To help you mitigate this risk, here are some best practices to consider. • Training and Education: Regularly educate employees about access control policies and the importance of data security. • Automation: Implement automated access control solutions wherever possible to reduce manual configuration errors. • Least Privilege Principle: Grant employees only the minimum access necessary for their roles, following the principle of least privilege. • Regular Auditing and Monitoring: Continuously monitor and audit access control settings to identify and address unauthorized access or anomalies. Conclusion In summary, personal data has become an increasingly alluring target for hackers, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding its privacy. Luckily, data privacy technologies are evolving swiftly, addressing many of the hardest challenges posed by the modern world. I believe that the advancement of encryption and zero-knowledge proof technologies, coupled with organizations' efforts to minimize human errors, will help ensure the continued protection of sensitive data privacy.

That ersatz … [+10938 chars]",Panama,"A rendering of a Crowley/BWXT nuclear ""power ship"" at work Almost a hundred years ago, the United States was the first country to use a ship to project electrical power ashore. That ersatz engineering effort helped a U.S. coastal community survive a crushing drought, and fueled development of an entirely new maritime platform. Today, as small modular nuclear reactors move from prototypes to reality, America stands, once again, on the threshold of a similar maritime power revolution, leveraging mobile sea “power” to help aid communities ashore. Many out there look to the U.S. Navy to move things along. But the Navy, while it leads the world in employing small nuclear reactors, makes an imperfect partner for today’s innovative ship-to-shore power platforms. The Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency—a department familiar with managing both nuclear risk and disaster recovery—is a far better choice to refresh America’s long-forgotten legacy of projecting power—electrical power—from the sea to shore. It will take funding and aggressive White House leadership to implement, but a FEMA fleet of nuclear-powered power generation vessels, built to bolster damaged or hurting electrical grids, can solve several pressing national issues. First, it can push civil development of nuclear power into the maritime. As a civilian, government-managed enterprise, a FEMA-managed disaster-response power-projection fleet can quickly bring new, clean, no-emission modular nuclear power plant designs to point where they are commercially viable. Second, by moving stewardship of this modern technology from the military sector to the civilian world, a FEMA disaster-response fleet gives the Department of Defense a much-needed civilian partner to help socialize the new technologies at sea. A civilian buffer between the Navy’s insular and secretive nuclear navy reduces risk of information loss while enabling wider and deeper public engagement. A FEMA power-generation fleet helps the military in other ways too. With a civilian assistance fleet, the military can avoid entanglement in unwanted portions the National disaster-response mission set. And yet, the military also gains a partner in helping to stabilize America’s strategically important territories and, potentially, some friendly island democracies. With DHS
DHS
 already managing the U.S. Coast Guard, DHS administrators can follow a similar organizational template, aligning the civilian fleet for easy transfer to the Defense Department and preparing the oft-overlooked DHS shipyard in Baltimore for nuclear maintenance work. America needs this asset. Today, power is a more vital community lifeline than ever. In areas of instability, where disasters and conflict are now supercharged by powerful storms and abrupt climactic shifts, everything from basic economic development to disaster recovery is impossible without reliable and ready access to power. With several designs for new nuclear-powered electrical generation ships already on offer, a disaster-response fleet of reactor-equipped power generation vessels and barges makes sense. A disaster response fleet is a good way to justify operational evaluation of the various technical options out there. On a strategic level, the use case is simple. America’s island holdings and remote border states are more strategically important than ever. Beset by tropical storms, high energy prices and almost no political power in Washington, these isolated forward territories have struggled to maintain solid electrical generation infrastructure. Mobile power-generation platforms can do a lot to help when island power grids start coming apart. Put bluntly, power projection ashore is a critical unmet need in America’s geopolitical toolbox. America still hasn’t learned a lesson from twenty years ago. In 2003, America’s inability to quickly reconstitute the grid in Iraq’s urban areas was directly attributable to the emergence of civil unrest and resistance. Failure to reconstitute power—be it in hurricane-struck New Orleans, a beleaguered missile-hit Kyiv, or in the streets of Apra, Guam, power generation is the coin of credibility for modern societies and governments. As aid and assistance, electrical power is one of the most high-yield investments any country can make. The newly-constructed USS Lexington was one of the first maritime platforms to project electrical ... [+] power ashore America Has A Legacy Of Projecting Power Ashore After Emergencies: The Administration may struggle to justify the investment this new, low-emission technology. Efforts to grapple with extreme weather and rapid climate shifts is controversial fare for Congress, but America’s century-long record of using power ships and barges to address climate challenges is undeniable. The only problem is that nobody in Washington knows industrial history. America’s long and proud record of employing safe, maritime power generation is largely forgotten, and the industry itself is ignored. America has a strong record of success in afloat power generation. In 1929, after a severe drought cut hydroelectric generation sources in the Pacific Northwest, one of America’s first aircraft carriers, the USS Lexington (CV-2), powered the city of Tacoma for a month. For the Tacoma area, that electricity prevented economic disaster. It helped America’s national security too, by keeping the lights on at what today is now Joint Base Lewis-McChord. The world’s first power generation barge, the converted merchant ship SS Jacona, was converted in 1930, after a winter storm destroyed major transmission lines in the northeast. After supporting power generation needs in northern New England, it supplied power to Hawaii, South Korea and Okinawa before being sold in 1971. The world’s first floating nuclear power plant, the MH-1A Sturgis (formerly the Liberty-class cargo ship SS Charles H. Cugle), generated power in Panama from 1968 to 1976, helping the Canal Zone weather a drought that limited access to hydroelectric power. With the Suez Canal closed, and the Vietnam conflict raging, the Panama Canal was breaking traffic records and needed the extra electricity to keep the locks operating. The Navy’s legacy fleet of about 14 floating power barges—a grab bag of designs ranging from purpose-built barges to converted tankers, converted cargo ships, or even dry dock sections hosting an array of different types of generators—have faded from memory. Only a few people realize U.S. power barges were prototype platforms testing all kinds of operational scenarios. America’s power barges and power ships have been used to power everything from tropical islands to Distant Early Warning radars out at Thule, Greenland, near the Arctic Circle. In World War II, alone, seven destroyer escorts were converted to serve as floating power-ships/power barges. Up until the seventies and eighties, America used World War II-era power barges and power ships to power war-hit cities, keep critical ports open, radar sites operational and even to dredge strategic anchorages and fleet concentration areas. With a high-profile fleet of FEMA power-generation ships, the U.S. can recover this lost chapter of America’s industrial legacy. By gaining operational time and experience with modular reactor designs, the U.S. government can use a wide-ranging FEMA fleet to refine modern operational and regulatory expectations. A perfect application for America’s romantic pragmatism, this new disaster response fleet can set the groundwork for wider maritime exploitation of clean, safe modular nuclear reactors. A conventional power barge arrives in Cuba. If America does not act, China, Turkey or some other ... [+] fast-moving country will fill the vacuum. The Business Case For An American Nuclear “Power Projection” Fleet: A true “power projection” fleet makes sense, particularly for America’s strategically-important forward territories. In Puerto Rico alone, FEMA, after a series of storms and earthquakes, has obligated more than $9.4 billion to keep the island’s battered electrical system operational. At that level of investment, America could have fielded several powerships—platforms that would be available today for activities beyond just supporting Puerto Rico. Mobile “power-projection” support at sea is needed. Today, the strategic islands of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are America’s front-line communities. But they are in typhoon country too. It’s simply inappropriate and strategically silly to let these power grids struggle after a disaster or wallow in management challenges. The island grids break often. In 2015, Typhoon Soudelor compromised Saipan’s 104-megawatt power grid. In 2018, two super typhoons ripped through Saipan, Tinian and Rota, disrupting power on those islands for months. Right now, Guam is still trying to recover from a 2015 explosion and fire at their main Cabras power plant. It is simply unacceptable that, today, Guam faces regular rotating blackouts. But the list of power generation problems facing Guam is enormous. Critical base-load combustion turbines require a hot exchange and repair in the Continental United States. The generation facility to replace the broken Cabras generation complex is behind schedule, with typhoon damage pushing that start back almost two years—to the end of 2025. Procurement protests have shaved production from other important generators by 75%. The situation is critical. Right now, Guam has 234 megawatts of generation capacity while Guam’s peak demand is in the vicinity of 220 megawatts. Certainly, conventional floating power plants can provide the same support. But, unlike nuclear power generators, they can’t do it alone. Conventional power plants need fuel, and that means added infrastructure, a fuel supply, and potentially more ships to carry fuel oil, diesel, gas, biofuel, or some type of natural gas, or maybe, in the future, methanol, ammonia or hydrogen. For a disaster-hit site, thousands of miles from anywhere, the logistical cost adds up. Fuel surcharges—particularly for remote regions—can boost retail energy prices by 400-500 percent. In an emergency, those costs are even higher. Floating nuclear power plants make political sense. The Secretary of the Navy, Carlos Del Toro, is proposing something a lot of us have been urging for a long time—a “new maritime statecraft,” integrating the various aspects of America’s maritime power into a cohesive, unified whole. It’s time for the Administration to put its money where its mouth is. This call to introduce a new agency into America’s wider maritime family, using it as an opportunity to both revitalize America’s waterfront as well as to help jump-start America’s nascent nuclear industry—while bolstering the islands and towns on the front lines of an increasingly contested maritime—is an easy win. And if we don’t move on it, right now, China, where researchers are busy producing engineering papers exploring the technical challenges of restarting dead electrical grids on islands, will."

Researchers are warning that ... [+] greenhouse gas emissions have led the Earth's climate into ""uncharted territory,"" posing serious threats to natural and human systems. A distinguished international team of scientists on Tuesday issued the starkest warning yet that human activity is pushing Earth into a climate crisis that could threaten the lives of up to 6 billion people this century, stating candidly: “We are afraid of the uncharted territory that we have now entered.” Writing in the journal Biosciences, the coalition of 12 researchers, spanning North America, Europe and Asia, state in unusually stark language: “As scientists, we are increasingly being asked to tell the public the truth about the crises we face in simple and direct terms. The truth is that we are shocked by the ferocity of the extreme weather events in 2023.” Record climate anomalies seen around the world in 2023 have astonished the scientific community, raising concerns that further extreme weather, as well as climate tipping points, could arrive sooner than expected. The authors say that the temperature records, which smashed all previous observations, along with record low levels of sea ice, are signs that human activity is “pushing our planetary systems into dangerous instability.” Such instability, they warn, means that in this century as many as 6 billion of the Earth’s almost 8 billion people could find themselves in regions that are no longer habitable due to climate impacts such as extreme heat and dwindling food supplies. The report is a major update to a 2019 bulletin, since co-signed by more than 15,000 scientists from 163 countries, that called on governments to make serious and rapid changes to current, high-emitting economic systems or face “untold suffering” worldwide. Drawing on the cumulative body of Earth systems research, from disciplines spanning atmospheric physics, oceanography, biology, paleoclimatology and human geography, Tuesday’s Biosciences report shows that the world is now undergoing changes at a speed never before seen in human existence. Juxtaposed against the “minimal progress” among governments to slow climate change, the authors write, “It is the moral duty of us scientists and our institutions to clearly alert humanity of any potential existential threat and to show leadership in taking action.” An aerial view of Carti Sugtupu, in the Indigenous Guna Yala Comarca, Panama, in the Caribbean Sea, ... [+] taken on August 29, 2023. Hundreds of islanders are preparing to pack up and move to escape the rising waters that threaten to engulf their homes, as experts predict the archipelago will disappear by the end of the century. “Life on our planet is clearly under siege,” William Ripple, distinguished professor of ecology at Oregon State University and a lead author of the report, told media. “The statistical trends show deeply alarming patterns of climate-related variables and disasters. We also found little progress to report as far as humanity combating climate change.” Co-lead author Christopher Wolf, a postdoctoral scholar at Oregon State University, added: “Without actions that address the root problem of humanity taking more from the Earth than it can safely give, we’re on our way to the potential collapse of natural and socioeconomic systems and a world with unbearable heat and shortages of food and freshwater.” This latest warning follows hot on the heels of a report released Monday that indicated melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would continue to accelerate this century regardless of how much fossil fuel use is reduced. The British Antarctic Survey, which authored the report, warned that its findings suggest previous forecasts have seriously underestimated the potential rate and extent of sea level rise, with the West Antarctic Ice Sheet containing enough ice to raise global sea levels “by up to five metres,” or more than 16 feet. As well as still-rising fossil fuel emissions, the authors of the Biosciences report discuss other mechanisms that could have contributed to the year’s truly astounding climate anomalies, including rising rainfall and dust from North Africa, additional water vapor caused by an underwater volcano eruption and regulatory changes that have led to lower sulfate aerosols from ocean shipping—aerosols that are thought to have helped scatter sunlight and created more reflective clouds, thereby partly cooling the planet. In their conclusion, the authors call for governments and communities to change their perspective on climate change, “from being just an isolated environmental issue to a systemic, existential threat.” They point out that rising temperatures are just one, interconnected part of a larger problem that incorporates biodiversity loss, fresh water scarcity and pandemics, all of which are caused by the increasing demands of humans and “overexploitation of our planet.” The researchers further warn that simply switching to renewable energy from fossil fuel sources will not be sufficient to ensure the continuation of natural and human systems. In their recommendations, they call for:   Despite the dire warning, the authors, who also include British chemist Sir David King, Bangladeshi scientist Saleemul Huq, and Swedish researcher Johan Rockström, end their report with a message of hope. ""This is our moment to make a profound difference for all life on Earth,"" they write. ""We must embrace it with unwavering courage and determination to create a legacy of change that will stand the test of time.""

Teaching and construction unions led calls against the contract withenvironmentalists, saying continued development threatens forested land and crucial groundwater just 75 miles (120 kilometers) west of the capital, in the state of Colon. Across Panama City, peaceful protesters handed out fliers, but in some areas on the outskirts of the capital police met protesters with tear gas. In anticipation of the largest marches since a cost of living crisis last July, both the Department of Education and the University of Panama cancelled classes. The government used social media to highlight the “enormous contribution” the mine — Panama's largest private investment ever — makes to the country's economy. In March, Panama's legislature reached an agreement with Canadian mining company First Quantum, allowing its local subsidiary, Minera Panama, to continue operating a huge open-pit copper mine in central Panama for at least 20 more years. The mine was temporarily closed last year when talks between the government and First Quantum broke down over payments the government wanted to receive. Protests began after President Laurentino Cortizo signed off on that contract on Friday after it was approved by the congress. The president acted surreptitiously, according to Fernando Abrego, leader of Panama's Association of Teachers union. “The government decided this confrontation by quickly and expeditiously approving a contract they know is rejected by the people,” he said. Teachers were joined by construction workers, who are one of country's most powerful labor groups. “The people are in the streets in defense of sovereignty,"" said union leader Saúl Méndez, ""in the face of a contract that cedes self-determination by devastating the environment to steal resources.” It is unclear how persuasive these arguments will prove against the economic boon of a single mining site that already brings in 3% of the nation’s gross domestic product. Minera Panama says the mine will employ thousands of Panamanians and that its shipments make 80% of the country's total exports. The new contract, initially slowed by labor disagreements, secures Panama at least $375 million a year from Minera Panama, over 10 times more than the previous deal. It represents one of the largest national mining contracts in a region where other countries like Costa Rica regulate the sector more stringently and El Salvador which banned metal mining in 2017. For teachers, however, Abrego said concession was not an option, and that the teachers' union would hold an assembly to plan their next actions. “We will remain in the streets,” he said."

With his energy and leadership, they have become a top U.S. logistics company.   The world of shipping and logistics is always changing. The past four years, from the Covid pandemic to the economic recovery and supply chain crisis that followed it, have shown that the global supply chain is prone to disruption but also innovation. As a shipping and logistics professional who has owned and operated an international freight forwarding company for over 23 years, I’ve seen many trends come to pass. Now, I’d like to share six key trends that are likely to affect shipping and logistics in 2024 and beyond. 1. Digitalization Although digitalization in shipping has been talked about for a long time, by next year, it will finally be a reality for many shippers. The bottom line is that the Covid pandemic and transition to remote work forced the shipping and logistics industry to digitalize. Big shipping players such as Maersk, MSC, Hapag-Lloyd and others digitized. But something miraculous happened: Boutique shipping companies also digitalized, and in many cases, they implemented their own software systems and tools for their customers. Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology could further digitalize and automate the world of shipping. It is expected that developments in those areas will improve real-time shipment tracking and supply chain visibility to build on the software that has already been deployed in the industry. Another massive move toward digitalization is the introduction of paperless shipping. At freight forwarders such as MTS Logistics, we are 100% paperless as of 2023. Others are following suit, as digital platforms take a greater role in shipping. 2. Economic Headwinds After a rocky pandemic-era economic period and post-Covid economic shockwaves, every businessperson hopes that tough economic times are behind us. There are many aspects of the economy to feel confident in: rising wages, steps toward a reduced income gap, reduced regulations and, yes, inflation finally starting to decrease. However, many challenges remain. Inflation is not yet low enough that shippers can increase their revenue and profits without increasing costs. In Q3 2023, fuel prices rose dramatically, and that has been passed down to major ocean shipping lines. With Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ countries having reduced global oil production, more volatility is likely ahead in 2024.  3. Sustainability Sustainability and greener business practices have been discussed for years. But with frequent and costly natural disasters becoming the norm amid a changing climate, the shipping and logistics industry has started to step up and take bold steps. There have been regulations implemented by global shipping regulators such as the International Maritime Organization’s “IMO 2020” rule, requiring cleaner fuel and retrofitted emissions scrubbers installed on older vessels. By 2024, more bold action will likely have been announced. Water shortages, such as the low water levels seen this year in the Panama Canal, and excessive drought throughout the western United States, are here to stay. Ports all over the world have been forced to suspend operations periodically due to climate-related events. The private sector has stepped up over the past few years with initiatives to promote zero-carbon shipping by 2050 (and in some cases sooner). Shipping leaders such as Maersk have led the way, and new ships are being built with electricity and alternative fuel sources in mind. Still, it will be a while until logistics is completely green. 4. Last-Mile Delivery The last-mile delivery ecosystem has changed rapidly over the past few years, and by 2024, major U.S. retailers will have taken steps to take over many aspects of their last-mile delivery operations. Over the past few years, Walmart, Target and Home Depot all expanded their last-mile delivery options, opting to take over some operations from existing carriers in order to offer services like faster deliveries. Many retailers have also opted for same-day delivery offerings. With regulations and oversight having been implemented, autonomous delivery solutions, such as self-driving trucks, could enter real-world use as early as 2024. Last-mile delivery continues to be a challenging part of logistics, especially after supply chain issues in 2021 and 2022. Major companies are exploring partnerships with new fulfillment partners and even taking on last-mile delivery themselves. That trend should continue. 5. Supply Chain Resilience The Covid pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains. In response, companies are rethinking their supply chain strategies to enhance resilience and implement risk management. This includes diversifying suppliers, changing how goods are sourced and, for some companies, just having a plan. Analytics is becoming even more important and will play a big role in identifying potential risks and associated responses. 6. Cybersecurity As the shipping and logistics world digitizes, cybersecurity is becoming more important than ever. In 2024, it is likely that the shipping industry at-large, as well as related partners, will invest heavily in cybersecurity. The United States has invested in cybersecurity for government operations, and the private sector has started to do so on a vast scale. Now, it will be time for shipping to do the same as more sensitive data is moved into the cloud and shippers realize that cyber risks have grown exponentially since the Covid pandemic. The industry is likely to invest heavily in cybersecurity to protect sensitive data, safeguard cargo from theft and prevent cyberattacks that threaten operations. Multifactor authentication will continue to become the norm in shipping and logistics, as it has in other industries. As an experienced shipping professional, I have watched the beginnings of each of these six trends take hold in recent years. I have no doubt that 2024 will be a year of profound investment and focus on the future in the areas of digitalization, sustainability, last-mile delivery, supply chain resilience and cybersecurity. At the same time, the global economy will pose new challenges for the shipping and logistics industry.

He noted that the issue will be addressed at a coming summit of Latin American leaders to be held in the Mexican state of Chiapas on October 22. According to Lopez Obrador, the US opened these sites in certain countries to regulate migration and provide greater security. However, the proposal was declined when Washington asked Mexico to create such centers to issue temporary visas.“We have not accepted it. We want to talk to the presidents first,”the Mexican leader said, referring to the upcoming meeting. “We don’t want to set up places in our country for them (migrants) to wait to be given temporary (US) visas,”he stressed.“We want this to be where the migration originates, where the migrants come from, so they don’t need to come to Mexico,”the president added. On October 2, the Mexican president revealed that the number of migrants arriving in his country through the southern border, where Chiapas is situated, had increased to 6,000 per day. Meanwhile, 10,000 migrants per day came to the northern border the previous week. Chiapas borders Guatemala, where a US-funded migrant processing center has already opened. Amid the rising tide of asylum seekers, Mexico will hold a summit with 11 Latin American leaders to discuss the growing flow of migrants heading toward the US border. The leaders of Ecuador, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Belize, Guatemala, Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, Costa Rica, and Panama have been invited to attend because these countries“have the most influence in everything related to migration,”Lopez Obrador said. Last week, the Cuban Foreign Ministry declared a“noticeable growth”in the irregular migration of its citizens through the Central American corridor to the US. The statement mentions that the economic embargo limits the population's standard of living, which encourages migration. According to US government data, the number of Cuban immigrants who arrived in the country last year reached 250,000 or more, which is over 2% of the island’s population."
